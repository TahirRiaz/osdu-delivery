# schedule

The top-level `schedule:` block declares WHEN a flow should run: either a cron expression evaluated in a time zone, or a fixed interval in seconds. It is parsed on every flow document kind (file flows and `flowType: ing`, `api`, `cpy`, `sftp`, `exp`, `trl`, `sp`, `inv`, `hc`, `cal`, `scm`, `batch`) because it is captured on the document envelope (`FlowDocument.Schedule` in src/SqlFlow.Yaml/YamlDocumentLoader.cs), not on any one flow model. Every kind that becomes a catalog pipeline then schedules identically, source-control snapshots (`scm`) included: a snapshot is excluded from the lineage graph, so it never joins a wave, but a schedule naming it fires it directly. The one exception is `batch`, which declares no flow of its own and so projects no pipeline for a schedule to attach to; a batch is ordered by lineage and triggered explicitly. The block is purely declarative: the engine itself never schedules anything. `sqlflow db sync` mirrors the block into the catalog schedule table, and the control plane's scheduler service fires it by enqueuing a run onto the same durable queue a manual trigger uses.

```yaml
name: orders
schedule:
  cron: "0 6 * * *"
  timezone: "Europe/Oslo"
source:
  type: csv
  location: ./orders.csv
target:
  connection: ${env:SQLFLOW_CONN_DWH}
  schema: dbo
  table: Orders
```

## Keys

| Key | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cron` | string | one of `cron` / `intervalSeconds` | none | Cron expression: 5 fields (minute granularity) or 6 fields with a leading seconds field. Evaluated in `timezone`. |
| `intervalSeconds` | int | one of `cron` / `intervalSeconds` | none | Fixed number of seconds between fires. Must be positive. |
| `timezone` | string | no | `"UTC"` | IANA time zone id the cron expression is evaluated in, for example `Europe/Oslo`. Ignored for interval schedules. |
| `enabled` | bool | no | `true` | Whether the schedule is active. A disabled schedule is recorded in the catalog but never fires. |
| `catchup` | bool | no | `false` | Whether missed occurrences (the host was down past a fire) are backfilled. `false` skips the missed fire and resumes at the next occurrence after now; `true` fires one missed occurrence per scheduler tick until the schedule is current again. |
| `maxConcurrency` | int | no | `4` | How many of the schedule's members execute at the same time. Because waves are gated, this is the width of the running wave. `1` runs the fire strictly serially; `0` opts out and runs the wave unbounded. See [Fire width](#fire-width-maxconcurrency). |
| `scope` | string | no | `"flow"` | How much the fire runs: `flow` (only the declaring flow), `node` (that flow plus every flow downstream of it), or `batch` (every active flow in the declaring flow's batch). See [Scope](#scope-what-a-fire-runs). |

| `name` | string | no | none | Publishes this inline schedule under a name so other flows can reuse it with `schedule: <name>`. Metadata only: the cadence still applies to this flow. See [Reusable schedules](#reusable-schedules-define-once-reference-by-name). |

Exactly one of `cron` or `intervalSeconds` must be set for the schedule to be armed. A block that sets neither is treated as absent: the loader parses it to no schedule at all (src/SqlFlow.Yaml/YamlDocumentLoader.cs, `MapSchedule`), so an empty block is never stored as a broken schedule.

## Fire width: `maxConcurrency`

A fire enqueues its whole member set as one wave-gated run group: no member is claimable until every member of a
lower wave is terminal, so exactly one wave is eligible at a time and the members of that wave are free to run
together. `maxConcurrency` bounds how many of them actually do.

```yaml
schedules:
  trapeze_daily:
    cron: "3 7 * * *"
    timezone: Europe/Oslo
    maxConcurrency: 4     # at most 4 of the source's flows execute at once
```

**Why it belongs to the schedule.** The members of a wave almost always share one upstream, and that upstream is
usually the scarce resource: 23 flows reading a single modest SQL Server can exhaust its connection budget while the
estate still has plenty of worker capacity. The alternative lever, the worker's own
`ControlPlane:Worker:MaxConcurrentRuns`, is estate-wide, so lowering it to protect one fragile source throttles every
other source too. The bound belongs to the thing that fans out.

**Values.**

- Omitted takes the product default of **4** (`ScheduleDefaults.MaxConcurrency`). This is deliberately bounded rather
  than unbounded: a schedule nobody has tuned should not be able to open an unlimited number of connections against
  one server.
- `1` makes the fire strictly serial, one member after another.
- `0` is the explicit opt-out: the wave runs unbounded, limited only by worker capacity.
- A negative value is not a usable bound. The schedule-library loader warns and falls back to the default rather than
  storing a value that would leave every member unclaimable.

**How it is enforced.** The schedule's bound is stamped onto each member run at enqueue
(`CatalogRun.GroupMaxConcurrency`, copied from `CatalogSchedule.MaxConcurrency`), and the queue's claim gate refuses
to claim a member while that many siblings of its group are already running. Stamping rather than joining keeps the
claim a single-table read on the queue's hot path, and means a group already in flight keeps the bound it was queued
under: editing the schedule never retunes a wave that is already running.

**Precision.** The bound is exact per node, because a node's drain loop claims strictly one run at a time. Across a
multi-node fleet two nodes can pass the check on the same free slot, so the wave can overshoot by at most
(claiming nodes minus one). Making it exact would require a range lock over the group on every claim, serializing the
fleet's hot path to enforce what is a soft resource limit; treat the number as "about this many".

**Existing schedules.** The catalog column is null (unbounded) for schedules synced before this key existed, and
takes the default on the next repo sync that rewrites the schedule row.

## Scope: what a fire runs

`scope` decides how much of the estate one fire executes. It answers the common case of a whole data source that must refresh together, without giving every flow its own schedule.

| Scope | What fires | Anchor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flow` (default) | Only the flow declaring the schedule, as a single run. | the flow itself |
| `node` | The flow plus every flow transitively downstream of it in lineage. | the flow itself |
| `batch` | Every active flow whose `batch:` matches the declaring flow's batch. | the flow's batch label |

A `node` or `batch` fire resolves its members through the lineage graph at fire time (the flow dependency edges and each pipeline's topological wave, via `RunScopeExpander`) and enqueues them as **one wave-gated run group** rather than as independent runs. The run queue's claim only hands a member to a worker once every member in a lower wave is terminal (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/RunQueueStore.cs, `ClaimSqlTemplate`), which gives the two guarantees that matter:

- **Waves run in order.** Wave N+1 starts only after every flow in wave N has finished, so a flow never runs before what it depends on.
- **A wave runs concurrently.** Members sharing a wave have no gate against each other and are claimed together.

Because the expansion is what actually runs, only the anchor declares the schedule. The other flows are pulled in by lineage and must **not** declare their own schedule, or each would fire the whole set again.

```yaml
# The source's one schedule, on its wave-1 acquisition flow.
name: baatbooking_00_cpy
batch: BB
schedule:
  scope: batch          # copy (wave 1) -> pre loads (wave 2) -> ods merges (wave 3)
  cron: "0 4 * * *"
  timezone: "Europe/Oslo"
```

Flows excluded from a group: anything inactive, and anything declaring `mode: manual` (its document reserved it for a direct trigger) or `mode: disabled` (deactivated: a retired source or run-once replay). A `node` anchor is the one exception, since naming it IS the manual trigger, and a node-scoped run can opt into "find all" (`includeAll` on the trigger/preview API, a switch in the GUI's run dialog) to deliberately replay manual and disabled descendants with their parent; a schedule fire never includes them. A scope that resolves to nothing runnable is logged and fires nothing rather than failing.

An unknown scope is rejected: `sqlflow db sync` warns and drops the schedule rather than silently narrowing it to the single flow, which would look like the rest of the set had quietly stopped running.

### Reading a schedule's plan

`GET /api/v1/schedules/{id}/plan` returns the cadence together with the resolved members in wave order, from the same expander the fire uses. It is the authoritative answer to "when does this source next update, and what runs in which order", and is exposed to the MCP server as `get_schedule_plan`.

The `schedule:` value may also be written as a bare scalar (`schedule: nightly`) to reuse a schedule defined elsewhere by name, instead of an inline block. See [Reusable schedules](#reusable-schedules-define-once-reference-by-name).

### Reading the YAML behind a schedule

`GET /api/v1/schedules/{id}/definition` returns where git declares the cadence and the text of that declaration, so a schedule can be read where it is operated instead of only in the repo. Every sync records the provenance on the schedule row (`DefinitionPath`, `DefinitionFlow`, `DefinitionYaml`):

- An inline `schedule:` block resolves to its declaring flow: the response carries that flow's name, its pipeline id, its repo-relative path, and the document text as the catalog stores it (secret-redacted, the same copy the flow's own YAML view serves).
- A `schedules.yaml` entry resolves to the library file, whose text is kept on the schedule row (nothing else in the catalog holds a library file).
- An API-created schedule has no file behind it, and answers with a null document rather than a reconstruction git does not contain.

The GUI's schedule list exposes this per row (the "View the YAML that defines this schedule" action).

### Whether the last fire worked

The schedule list and detail (`GET /api/v1/schedules`, `GET /api/v1/schedules/{id}`) carry `lastCounts`: the members of the last fire tallied by lifecycle state (queued, running, succeeded, failed, cancelled, skipped), or the single run's own state when the fire ran one flow. It is null when the schedule has never fired or its runs have aged out. The GUI rolls it up worst-wins into the status badge next to "Last run", the same rule a run group's header uses, so a set where one member failed reads as failed rather than merely "fired".

### cron

A standard cron expression parsed by Cronos. The field count decides the format (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/ScheduleClock.cs): five fields is standard minute granularity; six or more fields is parsed with a leading seconds field. Whitespace around the value is trimmed.

Cron syntax is NOT validated at YAML parse time. The YAML layer has no scheduling-library dependency; validation happens where the schedule is armed:

- During `sqlflow db sync`, an invalid cron or time zone causes the schedule to be skipped with the warning `'<flow>' (<file>) has an invalid schedule: <reason>` (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/CatalogSync.cs). The pipeline itself still syncs, and because only valid schedules are kept, a schedule row synced by an earlier run is removed by the same sync.
- On the schedule API, `ScheduleClock.TryValidate` rejects the request with HTTP 400 before storage.

Cron evaluation is time-zone aware with correct daylight-saving handling. By default the next fire is computed strictly after now, so a missed occurrence is skipped; set `catchup: true` to backfill missed occurrences instead (one per scheduler tick until current).

### intervalSeconds

A fixed interval: the next fire is simply now plus N seconds. The value must be positive. The validator counts a non-positive interval as unset (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/ScheduleClock.cs, `TryValidate`), so `intervalSeconds: 0` on its own fails with `a schedule must set exactly one of 'cron' or 'intervalSeconds'.`; a non-positive interval alongside a `cron` fails with `'intervalSeconds' must be a positive number of seconds.` `timezone` has no effect on interval schedules.

Setting both `cron` and `intervalSeconds`, or (via the API) neither, fails validation with `a schedule must set exactly one of 'cron' or 'intervalSeconds'.`

### timezone

An IANA time zone id such as `Europe/Oslo`, resolved through `TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById`. Blank or `UTC` (case-insensitive) resolves to UTC; the YAML loader normalizes a missing or blank value to `"UTC"`. An unknown time zone makes a cron schedule invalid: the catalog sync skips it with a warning, and the API rejects it with 400. On an interval schedule the value is ignored and not validated (`ScheduleClock.TryValidate` only resolves the time zone when a cron is present).

### enabled

Defaults to `true`. `enabled: false` stores the schedule but the scheduler never fires it. This is the declarative flag from the YAML (or the API create body); it is distinct from the operational `paused` flag described below.

## Reusable schedules: define once, reference by name

Repeating the same `schedule:` block across every flow of a source is a maintenance trap: change the cadence and you must edit every file. Instead a schedule can be defined once and referenced by name from any number of flows in the same repo. A flow references a shared schedule by writing the `schedule:` value as a bare scalar, the schedule's name:

```yaml
name: orders
schedule: nightly        # reuse the shared schedule named "nightly"
source:
  type: csv
  location: ./orders.csv
target:
  connection: ${env:SQLFLOW_CONN_DWH}
  schema: dbo
  table: Orders
```

A named schedule is defined in one of two ways, and both share a single per-repo namespace:

1. **A dedicated `schedules.yaml` library file.** Any file named `schedules.yaml` or ending in `.schedules.yaml`, anywhere in the repo, whose top-level `schedules:` key maps a name to a cadence. This is the natural home for a source's schedules (src/SqlFlow.Yaml/YamlScheduleLibraryLoader.cs):

   ```yaml
   # schedules.yaml
   schedules:
     nightly:   { cron: "0 6 * * *", timezone: "Europe/Oslo" }
     every-15m: { intervalSeconds: 900 }
     weekly:    { cron: "0 5 * * 1", timezone: "UTC", catchup: true }
   ```

   Each entry's fields are exactly a flow's inline `schedule:` block (`cron` or `intervalSeconds`, `timezone`, `enabled`, `catchup`, `maxConcurrency`, `scope`); the map key is the reference name. A library file is not a flow document (the flow scan globs `*.flow.yaml`) and never becomes a pipeline. An entry that declares neither a cron nor an interval is dropped with a warning.

2. **A named inline block on a flow.** An inline `schedule:` block may carry a `name:` key to publish itself for reuse. That flow still runs on its own inline schedule, and any other flow in the repo can reference it by that name:

   ```yaml
   # invoices.flow.yaml: defines "nightly" inline and uses it
   name: invoices
   schedule:
     name: nightly
     cron: "0 6 * * *"
     timezone: "Europe/Oslo"
   # ... orders.flow.yaml elsewhere just writes:  schedule: nightly
   ```

References are resolved during the estate scan, where the whole repo is visible (src/SqlFlow.Lineage/Collection/FlowSetCollector.cs), after which each referencing flow carries the resolved cadence exactly as if it had been written inline. Resolution rules:

- The two definition sources share one case-insensitive namespace. If a name is defined more than once (across library files and named inline blocks), the first definition wins and the redefinition is warned.
- A reference to a name that nothing defines leaves that flow **unscheduled**, with the warning `'<flow>' (<file>) references schedule '<name>', which no schedules.yaml or named inline block defines; the flow is left unscheduled.` A dangling reference never produces a wrong or broken schedule.
- Cron/interval syntax of a resolved schedule is validated exactly as an inline one (see below); the resolved cadence flows through the same catalog sync.

A `schedule: <name>` reference is only resolvable by the full estate scan (`sqlflow db sync`), which sees the whole repo. The targeted per-run write-back that keeps a run-only catalog current parses a single flow file and cannot see the library, so it leaves a referenced schedule for the next full sync to reconcile rather than mirror an unresolved reference (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/CatalogSync.cs, `MirrorSingleFlowScheduleAsync`).

## From YAML to the catalog: sync semantics

`sqlflow db sync <dir>` mirrors git-declared schedules into the catalog schedule table with `Source = 'yaml'` (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/CatalogSync.cs):

- The schedule is refreshed from the YAML on every sync; git is the source of truth for `yaml` schedules.
- An operator's API pause survives a re-sync: `paused` is an operational override that a git refresh does not clear.
- Schedules created through the API (`Source = 'api'`) are never touched by sync.
- A schedule removed from git is removed from the table on the next sync.
- For duplicate flow names, the first wins (the duplicate was already warned about by the estate scan).
- The next fire is computed from the sync time (falling back to the sync time itself when none is computable), but it only replaces the stored `NextFireUtc` for a new schedule, one whose cron/intervalSeconds/timezone changed, or one with no next fire; an unchanged re-sync never disturbs the firing cadence (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/ScheduleStore.cs, `StageYamlUpsertAsync`).

## The scheduler service

`SchedulerService` (src/SqlFlow.ControlPlane/Background/SchedulerService.cs) is a control-plane background service that scans the catalog every `ControlPlane:Scheduler:PollSeconds` seconds (default 15, minimum 1; src/SqlFlow.ControlPlane/Configuration/ControlPlaneOptions.cs) and processes at most 200 due schedules per tick.

A schedule fires when it is `Enabled`, not `Paused`, and its `NextFireUtc` has arrived. Firing:

1. Computes the next occurrence: strictly after now by default (a missed occurrence is skipped), or, when `catchup` is set, strictly after the occurrence just fired (so an overdue schedule advances one occurrence per tick, firing each missed window until it is current).
2. Claims the occurrence with a compare-and-swap on `NextFireUtc`, so multiple control-plane nodes never double-fire the same occurrence. The winning claim also stamps `LastFireUtc`.
3. Skips the occurrence if the pipeline is inactive or removed (logged: `Schedule {ScheduleId}: flow '{FlowName}' is inactive or removed; not enqueued this occurrence.`); the next fire has already advanced, so the schedule simply tries again later.
4. Enqueues a run onto the same durable queue a manual trigger uses, then records the enqueued run id as `LastRunId`.

A malformed cron, an unknown time zone, or a cron with no future occurrence has no computable next fire: the claim advances `NextFireUtc` to null and the schedule is parked (logged: `... has no computable next fire (invalid cron/timezone or exhausted) and was parked.`). A tick error such as a transient database outage is logged and retried on the next tick.

Scheduled runs are enqueued untargeted (any node may claim them) with no explicit commit pin on the request; enqueueing itself pins the run to the repo's last successfully synced commit when one is known (src/SqlFlow.Catalog/RunQueueStore.cs).

## The schedule API

The control plane also manages schedules directly (src/SqlFlow.ControlPlane/Api/ScheduleEndpoints.cs). All routes are mounted under `/api/v1`. Reads require the `read` scope; mutations require `operate`.

| Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /schedules` | List, filterable by `repoId`, `pipelineId`, `source` (`yaml` or `api`), `enabled`; paged with `page` and `pageSize`. |
| `GET /schedules/{id}` | One schedule; 404 when unknown. |
| `POST /schedules` | Create an ad-hoc `api` schedule from `{repoId, flowName, cron OR intervalSeconds, timezone?, enabled?, catchup?, maxConcurrency?}`. 400 on a blank `flowName` or invalid timing; 404 when no active pipeline matches. |
| `POST /schedules/{id}/run` | Fire the schedule now, on demand (to test it): enqueues a run of its flow through the same durable path a scheduled fire uses and stamps `lastRunId`, without moving the next scheduled fire. 202 with `{runId}`; 404 when unknown; 409 when the flow is inactive or removed. |
| `POST /schedules/{id}/pause` | Set the operational `paused` flag. |
| `POST /schedules/{id}/resume` | Clear `paused` and recompute the next fire from now, so a long pause never releases a burst of missed fires. |
| `DELETE /schedules/{id}` | Remove the schedule; 204 on success, 404 when unknown. |

`ScheduleDto` fields: `id`, `repoId`, `pipelineId`, `flowName`, `cron`, `intervalSeconds`, `timezone`, `enabled`, `catchup`, `maxConcurrency`, `paused`, `source`, `nextFireUtc`, `lastFireUtc`, `lastRunId`, `createdUtc`, `updatedUtc`.

## Examples

An interval schedule, declared but not yet active:

```yaml
name: orders
schedule:
  intervalSeconds: 900
  enabled: false
source:
  type: csv
  location: ./orders.csv
target:
  connection: ${env:SQLFLOW_CONN_DWH}
  schema: dbo
  table: Orders
```

A second-granularity cron on an ingestion flow (6 fields, leading seconds field), fired every 30 seconds during business hours in Oslo:

```yaml
flowType: ing
name: staging-orders
schedule:
  cron: "*/30 * 8-17 * * MON-FRI"
  timezone: "Europe/Oslo"
connections:
  erp: ${env:SQLFLOW_SRC}
  dwh: ${env:SQLFLOW_DW}
source:
  server: erp
  object: AdventureWorks.Sales.Orders
target:
  server: dwh
  object: DW.raw.Orders
load:
  keyColumns: [OrderID]
```

Arm the schedules by syncing the repo into the catalog:

```bash
sqlflow db sync . --repo my-estate
```
