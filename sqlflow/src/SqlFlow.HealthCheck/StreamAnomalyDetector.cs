/// <para>
/// It is the zero-configuration counterpart of the <c>hc</c> flow. A health-check flow is the deep instrument:
/// it queries the monitored table along a declared date column, so it sees the shape of the data. That depth
/// costs a flow per table, which is why in practice a handful of tables get one and the rest of the estate
/// goes unwatched. This detector trades depth for coverage: the catalog already records rows inserted,
/// updated, and deleted for every run of every flow, so every stream is monitored the moment it runs once. The
/// estimators are the SAME ones (<see cref="RobustStatistics"/>, <see cref="TrendEstimator"/>,
/// <see cref="EsdDetector"/>, <see cref="PeltDetector"/>), so the two surfaces cannot disagree about what
/// abnormal means.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// <b>Reprocessing is removed before anything is fitted.</b> The caller drops the runs the log FLAGS as
/// backfills, and this detector then trims what those flags miss: a catch-up after an outage, a re-run kicked
/// off without backfill parameters, a source that delivered a year in one file. Any of those can be a thousand
/// times an ordinary day, and one of them left in the sample drags the median, the trend, and the rate
/// baseline so far up that every ordinary day afterwards reads as a collapse. The trim happens first, on
/// purpose: every number below is computed from the trimmed series, while the reported series keeps the truth.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>A zero-row day is judged against what this stream normally does on that kind of day.</b> Reliability is
/// learned per weekday from the stream's own history, so a feed that has never loaded at a weekend is not
