//! The SQLFlow MCP server: tool definitions and dispatch.
//!
//! Two capability tiers, mirroring DeltaForge's design:
//!   * **Offline** — the embedded reference corpus (doc tools) and the
//!     `.flow.yaml` analysis engine (`validate_flow`, key lookup). No network.
//!   * **Online** — a proxy over the control plane's `/api/v1` read surface
//!     (catalog, lineage, runs, schedules, search, summary) plus the operate
//!     surface (trigger/cancel), gated by device-flow authentication.

            statistics, with no per-table setup, so it covers every stream the platform writes rather than \
            the few that have a health-check flow. \
            \
            It answers three questions per table, RANKED because they are not equally urgent: zero data (an \
            outage, and the only category that can be critical), less data than normal (a degradation, \
            capped at warning), and more data than normal (information). Categories: stalled, failing, \
            gap-days, not-running, less-than-normal, more-than-normal, healthy, never-loaded, \
            insufficient-history. \
            \
            Reprocessing is removed BEFORE anything is measured, in two passes: the runs the log flags as \
            backfills are dropped, and the outsized days those flags missed are trimmed to a Tukey fence. \
            Without that, one history replay redefines a stream's normal and every ordinary day after it \
            reads as a collapse. \
            \
            A zero-row day is judged against what the table normally does on THAT KIND OF DAY: reliability \
            is learned per weekday, and how often it delivers is the median week rather than the mean day, \
            so a feed that never loads at weekends is not reported every Saturday and an outage cannot \
            teach the detector that outages are normal. Where the stream joins a schedule, the cadence \
            comes from its cron instead. \
            \
            Only streams on an ENABLED schedule are analysed by default: a flow nothing schedules has no \
            say in whether data is delivered. The answer reports how many were left out for that reason. \
            \
            Every stream carries a scope (source / internal) and a STAGE saying where in the pipeline it \
            sits: 'integration' fetches from the vendor, so nothing there usually means the vendor sent \
            nothing; 'file-ingestion' and 'archive' mean their data arrived and WE did not take it in; \
            'derived' is entirely our own processing. Use the stage to say whose problem a finding is. \
            \
            Six detectors vote. Three are PRIMARY and can raise a finding alone: silence (no data now), \
            nullDays (more empty days than the median week explains), cadence (the flow stopped running). \
            Three measure volume and corroborate: rateChange (overdispersion-adjusted count rate), \
            levelShift (PELT change point: halved and STAYED halved), volumeOutlier (generalized ESD). \
            Trust a finding with agreeingDetectors >= 2; treat a lone one as a lead. Each stream also \
            carries its learned PATTERN (shape, load weekdays, typical row band, reliability) and its \
            averages per run. \
            \
            Pass pipelineId to drill one stream down to its day-by-day series and every detector\'s \
            reasoning. Use insights_attention for run FAILURES and durations; use this for whether the \

- Every online result carries GUI deep links: each row gains a `links` object holding the page for the row
  itself (`page`, whatever it is: a table's catalog page, a flow, a run, a run group, a schedule's runs, a
  repo, a schema or database folder, a report, the fleet board), its lineage graph (`lineage`), and the
  things it references (`flow`, `object`, `objectLineage`, `otherObject`, `run`, `runGroup`, `schedule`,
  `lastRun`, `sampleRun`, `fromFlow`, `toFlow`). Links that leave SQLFlow arrive under their own names and
  are already absolute: `url` (a report's own address in Power BI/Tableau), `remote` (a repo's git remote),
  `source` (a flow's source location). When an answer names a table, flow, run, schedule, repo, or report,
  link that name with the URL the row carried, and render an external address as a link too rather than as
  bare text or inline code. Use them verbatim: never hand-build a SQLFlow URL, and never invent one for a
  row that came back without links. A result about something the CALL named rather than about its rows (a
  flow's columns, an object's columns, a repo's edges, one file's provenance, the insights boards, summary)
  carries the subject's links on the envelope beside `items`, so those answers have a destination too.
- \"Where does <name> live / where is <X> computed / what is <X>?\": call search_all FIRST. It fans one term
  across all seven surfaces at once and answers with each surface's full count plus a nextSteps plan naming
  the tool that pages it and the tool that turns a hit into an answer; work that plan rather than guessing a
  single-surface tool. The reason to start here is that the surfaces disagree about what exists: a name absent
  from the synced warehouse schema is routinely present in a flow's YAML (search_flows), in the columns a flow
  produces (search_flow_columns), or only in the SQL a run executed (search_statements). Searching one surface
  and reporting \"no mention in the catalog\" is how a real answer gets missed.
  Search matches word by word, not as a phrase: prefer a single identifier token, and read back the `tokens`
  field to see what was actually searched. When nothing matches, the reply carries an ordered checklist for
  widening the search (uncovered schemas, the flow surfaces, subscribers, the docs corpus); work it before
  answering that the name does not exist, and say which surfaces you checked.
- \"When does <source> update?\": list_schedules finds the schedule (its cron/timezone/next fire), then
  get_schedule_plan returns both the cadence AND the wave-ordered flows that fire runs. A schedule whose
  scope is 'node'/'batch' runs a whole set resolved through lineage, so the plan (not the schedule's own
  flow name) is what actually gets updated; members sharing a wave run concurrently.
- \"Is this delivery normal / how big are this source's files?\": pipeline_file_stats returns the flow's
  size profile (average, median, spread, extremes, totals) over its whole file history plus a window over
  the newest files. Read it before calling a load small, large, or missing: judge a file against the
  median and the standard deviation, and a regime change by recent-vs-all-time.
- Browse the schema: list_schemas gives every (server, database, schema) with its object count; then
  lineage_objects filters by database/schema/kind/name to enumerate the tables and views in one. This is how
  you answer open schema questions without a pre-known object key.
- Ask about an object (text-to-query): describe_object returns one object's identity, columns, generating
  script, module body, and lineage edges in one call: start here to reason about, or author SQL against, a
  specific table or view.
- \"When does <table> update / how is it populated / did its last load work?\": describe_object_refresh(key)
  answers all three at once: the writing flows, each flow's latest run, and the schedules that fire it with
  the next fire time. For a view it names the modules the content derives from instead; read them with
  describe_object.
- \"Where does <table>'s data come from / what feeds it / what depends on it?\": object_lineage(key) walks
  the graph transitively, upstream to the true origin (the source system's table, file, or API endpoint) and
  downstream to every dependent, each step naming the flow that carries the hop. Use it whenever the answer
  is more than one hop away; describe_object's edge list stops at the object itself.
- \"Which tables does this dashboard/report use?\": subscribers are the consumption side. list_subscribers
  (filter by type or search by name/owner) finds the report; describe_subscriber(key) lists every object its
  queries read and the SQL itself. The reverse (\"who consumes this table\") is in describe_object's
  `subscribers`. Then answer \"and how are those tables populated\" per table with describe_object_refresh.
- \"What is the computation formula for <column>?\": three places compute values, check in this order:
  search_flow_columns (an expression in a flow's transform), the owning view/procedure body via
  describe_object or search_definitions, and search_statements (SQL the engine composed at run time).
- \"It looks like data is missing\": never conclude from metadata silence. Locate the table (search_all),
  walk to its producers (describe_object_refresh), read their recent runs (list_runs, run_files) and compare
  the newest delivery against the flow's own norm (pipeline_file_stats: median, spread, recent window).
  insights_attention lists flows already failing, silent, or delivering zero rows.
- Performance and optimization: insights_recommendations is the one-call briefing (run-history advisories
  merged with warehouse DMV findings, each with ready-to-review SQL); insights_flows ranks flows by
  processing time with trends; insights_attention lists what is failing/degrading/silent; insights_steps
  drills a slow flow to its hot steps and their SQL. When the warehouse dimension is missing or stale, run
  analyze_warehouse_health (missingIndexes / statisticsHealth / indexUsage / topQueries) and re-read.
  Suggested SQL from these tools is for human review, never for unreviewed execution.
- Operate (privileged): trigger_run, cancel_run, analyze_warehouse_health.

SQLFlow authors T-SQL against SQL Server and orchestrates it with `.flow.yaml` documents. It is a
distinct product from DeltaForge; use these tools and the embedded corpus as the source of truth.";
