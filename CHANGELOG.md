# Changelog

All notable changes to OSDU Delivery are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Records built in steps.** A delivery flow's `enrich:` steps extend each record its mapping renders: each step
  renders a fragment (a mapping with `fragment: true`) from rows of its own, a table joined to the record on its key,
  and can read what the mapping and the steps before it added with `$base`. The record is rendered as one chain and
  sent once, so a change to the record's row, to a step's rows, to a fragment or to the cache values they read writes
  it once, and a change that renders the same record sends nothing. `sqlflow check` lists the steps and
  `sqlflow preview` shows what each added ([enrich](osdu/docs/reference/flow/enrich.md),
  [fragments](osdu/docs/reference/flow/mapping-fragment.md)). A flow without steps renders and hashes as before.

- **Export records to Excel.** A delivery flow's Records tab has **Export**, which downloads every record its filter
  matches (up to 25,000) as an Excel workbook to work through where the records come from: a row for each record with its
  status, issue and problem, the file and row it came from, its key's parts and where it landed in OSDU, and an About sheet
  saying what was exported. The Records page exports what its lookup reaches the same way, each record with its flow, and
  `sqlflow records export` writes the same file ([records export](osdu/docs/reference/cli/records.md#records-export)).

- **A repository's files open as code.** On a repo's page, a click on a flow, a mapping, a template or any other file
  shows its code in a window that slides in from the left over the page, syntax-coloured, resized by dragging its edge
  and maximized to read it alone, where a click used to open only a flow's page and other files did nothing. A flow's
  file offers Open pipeline. Files holding credentials (an environment file, a private key) and, in a repo synced from a
  local folder, files git ignores are not shown
  ([What a repository holds, and its page](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md#what-a-repository-holds-and-its-page)).

- **Sync and fire from GitHub after a merge.** An external trigger (Admin > **External triggers**) lets a GitHub
  workflow sync a repository at the commit it merged and then fire the schedules it picks, proving who it is with the
  token GitHub mints for the job, so no secret is stored; SQLFlow's action (`sqlflow/integrations/github`) follows the
  request and puts the sync's lines, each fire and every run in the job's log, the summary on the job's page and the
  traces in an artifact, and the page writes the workflow for the schedules a merge fires
  ([Syncing and firing schedules from GitHub](sqlflow/docs/reference/guides/github-actions.md)). A system that cannot
  present GitHub's token uses a key trigger, and a deployment may declare its triggers in its configuration
  ([External triggers](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/external-triggers.md)).

- **Run a flow with the parameters its document declares.** The trigger dialog of every OSDU flow kind lists the flow's
  parameters with their descriptions and defaults, a list to pick from for a parameter's new `choices` (a run given
  another value is refused) or, for a delivery flow, the values the column it is looked up in holds, with how many rows
  hold each (a scope parameter's column, or `lookup.column`); a field left empty takes the document's value, and the
  dialog says what would refuse the run as it is filled in. The Preview tab and a mapping's data check take the same
  fields, and the Schedules page shows what every flow a schedule runs is given and what would refuse its run
  ([Parameters](osdu/docs/reference/flow/parameters.md)).

- **Smoke test a delivery on its first records.** A deliver, plan, intake or replan run's payload takes `maxRecords` (1
  to 1,000, or 0 for the whole scope), the trigger dialog's **Records at most**: the run reads only the first records of
  its scope, records not yet in the ledger included, and leaves the scope's watermark where it is, so the next run of the
  scope still reads every row ([Running an OSDU flow](osdu/docs/reference/cli/run.md#a-delivery-flows-payload)). A flow's
  `source.record.maxRecords` sets the default in its document, which every run of its scope takes unless it gives its own
  ([The first records of the scope](osdu/docs/reference/flow/delivery.md#the-first-records-of-the-scope)).

- **Explain any page or piece of code.** Explain at the end of the tab strip has the assistant tell someone new what the
  page is for and what they do there, and Explain on a code window (or "Explain this" in its right-click menu) explains
  the selected lines or the whole document; the conversation slides in from the left, can be widened, maximized and
  followed up, and is kept on the Assistant page
  ([Explain](sqlflow/docs/reference/guides/chat-assistant.md#explain)).

- Maintenance (Operate > Health) shows what the whole database holds, the `osdu` schema included: every table in areas a person
  recognises, each marked keep, safe to remove or optional, with its size, how its data leaves and what removing it
  costs. **Clean up** is the safe purge: what is safe to remove starts ticked, superseded delivery attempts, finished
  activities' logs and superseded assertion runs are optional and never ticked for you, each area shows what would go at
  the age chosen, and an admin cleans up or keeps the age as a limit the hourly automatic cleanup applies; nothing is
  removed until then ([What the osdu schema stores](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/storage-and-retention.md)).

- **A renamed flow keeps its history.** Rename a delivery, retrieval, assertion, dimension or inventory flow, or its file,
  changing nothing else, and the repository sync moves the old name's ledger to the new one and says so in its result: a
  delivery flow's records carry on with their history and OSDU ids, and only what changed is sent. A file copied by mistake
  takes the ledger until the copy is deleted, and the sync says so
  ([Renaming a pipeline](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/renaming-a-pipeline.md)).

- **A dimension's attribute reads what a pipeline aggregating the same records reads.** `many: max` keeps the greatest of
  the values an attribute reads over every record it reaches (a wellbore's greatest field name, as a `MAX` over its fields
  would), `many: join` and `many: all` every one, `decode: url` decodes percent-escapes (`g%2Fcm3` is `g/cm3`),
  `trim: false` keeps white space, `keep: reference` keeps a reference's version, and `maxReferences` follows up to 1,000
  records a step; a path's filter can compare a value of the record a reference names
  (`[GeoTypeID->data.Code=Country]`), a dimension's `lookupKinds` pins the kind each entity type is looked up in, an
  element's field takes `many`, `decode` and `trim`, and the elements take `nulls: keep`. A dimension reads up to 64
  attributes and fields, where it read 20
  ([Dimension labels and attributes](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-attributes.md)).

- **A dimension view groups its rows and joins a grouped view.** `groupBy` makes a view a row per key of its rows, its
  columns aggregates (`COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `STRING_AGG ... WITHIN GROUP`), text ordered by code point;
  `STRING_ESCAPE(..., 'json')` writes a JSON array per key; and a later view joins it on the key it groups by
  (`join: [{ on: WellLogID, view: <view> }]`), meeting one row of each
  ([Grouped views](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-views.md#grouped-views)).

- **An incremental dimension load can load in full when records leave the index.** `fullLoadWhenRecordsLeave: true`
  loads a dimension in full when a record its last full load read was soft deleted or no longer matches its query, so its
  keys go with the next build rather than the next full load
  ([Incremental loads](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-incremental.md)).

- **Orphaned ledgers are taken over from the GUI.** The Orphaned ledgers page lists the flows no repository declares any
  more whose ledgers still hold records or history, and hands a missing flow's ledgers to the declared flow you pick,
  suggesting the one that pins the same mapping: for a flow renamed and changed at once, deleted and added back in separate
  syncs, or renamed before this release
  ([Missing documents](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/renaming-a-pipeline.md#missing-documents-and-taking-them-over)).

- **The assistant links everything it names that the GUI can open.** In the GUI's chat, Slack or a desktop client, a
  record's label opens its page with its whole history, an OSDU id opens the explorer on that record in its partition,
  an OSDU kind the explorer on its records, and a flow, submission, test, template, cache version or change, dimension
  build, schedule or source file the page that shows it, on the interface and partition the answer is about
  ([links into the GUI](osdu/docs/reference/guides/mcp.md#links-into-the-gui)).

- **The Records page and the audit trail open in the partition a link names.** A link with `?partition=` makes it the
  title bar's, as the explorer already did, so a lookup or a flow's trail linked from another partition lands on what it
  names ([Records](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#records), [audit trail](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#audit-trail)).

- **How long things take is shown at every level.** A schedule's last fire, a run group, a pipeline's last and usual
  run, a submission and its work batches, the audit trail and a retrieval flow's runs say how long they took, and
  anything still executing counts up
  ([how long the last fire took](sqlflow/docs/reference/flow/schedule.md#how-long-the-last-fire-took),
  [a submission's page](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#a-submissions-page)).

- **An inventory finds the records OSDU holds more than once.** On an inventory's new **Duplicates** tab, build a key by
  clicking, in one of its records shown as JSON, the values the copies of one record hold equal, and **Find duplicates**:
  those properties of every id are downloaded, a search per 1,000 ids, and grouped at once by any key of them, with the
  groups' sizes to tell a key too broad. **Pick the copies to keep** then reads each group's copies: the one holding the
  most values is kept and the others are picked to remove, with the groups a rule cannot decide left for you to choose.
  Compare any two copies side by side, keep another copy, then select the copies to remove and remove them from the Ids
  tab; a copy is removed only while the copy its group keeps is still in OSDU
  ([finding duplicate records](osdu/docs/reference/flow/inventory-duplicates.md)).

- **A delivery's work location may name the deployment's storage.** `source.work` may open with a reference,
  `work: ${env:LANDING_URL}/.work/welllog/{logSource}`, which each run resolves with the values the control plane
  supplies ([delivery flow, source](osdu/docs/reference/flow/delivery.md#source)).

- **The workbench opens on a home page that asks the assistant.** Home greets you on the brand's navy with a question
  box: a question typed there, or one of the delivery questions it offers, opens the Assistant asking it. Under the
  headline counts, Delivery says how much of the title bar's partition is delivered, with Find a record and Open
  Delivery, and the newest runs sit beside the runs by state ([the home page](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#the-home-page)).

- **One run delivers several values of a scope parameter.** Give a parameter `source.record.scope` binds a list (several
  picked in its field in the GUI, `--set` repeated on the CLI, an array in a trigger, a sequence in a schedule's or a
  removal's `values`) and the run reads the rows holding any of them, as one scope with one watermark
  ([several values of a scope parameter](osdu/docs/reference/flow/delivery.md#several-values-of-a-scope-parameter)).

- **A canonical record links the custom records that stand beside it with `$child`.** A mapping of a kind other templates
  are linked to writes `$child: <kind>` on a property its template has room for, a property of `ExtensionProperties` or
  a tag on a canonical template, and each record links its child of that kind, the record with the same minted id, once
  OSDU holds it; until then the property is left out and the record is never held for it. When the child lands, the
  record is planned again and its flow's next run sends it with the link, its document alone. The mapping builder offers
  a **Child record** input and a template's sheet names its children ([Mapping $child](osdu/docs/reference/flow/mapping-child.md);
  the whole shape, both templates, mappings and flows, in [Linked records](osdu/docs/reference/guides/linked-records.md)).
- **Records a source no longer holds are taken out of OSDU by a removal flow.** A `flowType: removal` document reads the
  keys a source holds now, whole, from its files or a table, and optionally a list of the keys it removed, compares them
  with a delivery flow's ledger on a schedule of its own, and takes out of OSDU (reversibly) each record whose key is gone,
  once, recording it in that flow's ledger and keeping it out until a newer row arrives. A run that finds more gone than
  its guard allows takes nothing out and waits for an approval on the new **Removals** page, where every deletion is listed
  and can be delivered again; a delivery flow's **Deletions** tab, a record's page, `sqlflow removal` and
  `sqlflow records removed` and `lift-removal` show the same ([Removal flow](osdu/docs/reference/flow/removal.md)).
- **Records whose business keys OSDU already holds are adopted in one batch.** When the ids a flow's rows make from their
  keys are records OSDU already holds that no ledger claimed, written by an earlier deployment or another instance of the
  delivery, the records are held, and **Adopt (N)** on the flow's Delivery tab asks every one of them, records held so
  before this release included, once the partition is typed back; the next run takes each over at the version OSDU holds
  and writes the row there, so the ledger maintains it from then on, and the Records tab's selection, the Issues tab, a
  record's page and `sqlflow records adopt` ask fewer
  ([Adopting a record OSDU already holds](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/record-lifecycle.md#adopting-a-record-osdu-already-holds)).
- **A private GitHub repository can be read with a GitHub App instead of a personal access token.** Give the
  deployment a read-only App (`SQLFLOW_GITHUB_APP_ID` with its private key, or `github_app` in the Terraform and
  `githubApp` in the Bicep), or name one in a source's credential reference (`${githubapp:...}`), and every sync and
  checkout asks it for a short-lived token for that repository alone, so no token is stored and none belongs to a person
  ([Reading a private GitHub repository with a GitHub App](sqlflow/docs/reference/guides/github-app.md)).
- **The Repos page says which credential each repository is read with, and tests it.** A mark beside each remote, the
  repository page and the register dialog show whether a source reads with its own token, a GitHub App, the host's
  token or nothing; Git credentials shows the deployment's App and checks it with GitHub; Test access reads the branch
  tip with the credential a sync would use ([Git credentials](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md#git-credentials-a-reference-never-a-secret)).
- **A custom template can be linked to the canonical kind it stands beside.** A template file naming a record kind in
  `x-osdu-inheriting-from-kind` is linked to it: each of its records has a parent, the record of that kind with the same
  minted id, and the sync, the Templates page, the API (`parent`) and the MCP server's template tool say which
  ([Linked templates](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#linked-templates)).
- **A mapping reads sections of its records' parent with `$parent`.** A record of a linked template takes any section of
  its canonical parent from OSDU as it renders, such as the wellbore DDMS's references to a well log's curve files
  (`$parent: data.DDMSDatasets`), so a custom record delivered through storage points at the same bulk data; a record
  whose parent is not in OSDU is held, and is released and sent once the parent lands. The ledger keeps each record's
  parent and the version of it every document was rendered from, the record page links a record and its parent both
  ways, and the mapping builder offers the parent as an input ([Mapping $parent](osdu/docs/reference/flow/mapping-parent.md)).
- **Every table of the osdu schema has a reference page.** Each says what one row is, what every column holds, what
  each key and index serves and what writes and reads the table, and
  [The osdu schema](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/database.md) lists them by what they serve; the MCP server's
  `search_docs` searches them when its `type` is `table`.
- **A kind of the OSDU data definitions downloads as a template file.** **Download** on the Templates page's Browse
  OSDU tab, on a kind's row or in its sheet (`GET /api/v1/delivery/templates/osdu/file`), gives the kind's bundled schema,
  naming its kind, as the file a template folder keeps, under the kind's file name; **Download** in a repository
  template's sheet copies one a repository holds. `sqlflow template capture --out` writes the same form, with the keys in
  the order the schema was written rather than sorted ([Templates](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#a-template-as-a-file)).
- **A repository's template folders hold the templates its documents fill.** A folder named `templates`, anywhere in a
  repository and as many as it needs, holds the templates of the mappings, searches, assertion tests and dimensions
  beside and below it, read nearest first, so two projects of one repository can fill different versions of one kind.
  A repository adds and removes a template by committing and deleting its file; its sync records which file holds which
  template, and every reader reads the file ([Template folders](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#template-folders)).
- **A mapping can name its template's kind alone.** Leave `template.version`, or a search's `schema.version`, out and the
  mapping fills the one version of the kind the nearest template folder holding it holds; a folder holding two versions of
  the kind asks for the version ([How documents name their template](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#how-documents-name-their-template)).
- **A template of one's own is used as it is committed.** `sqlflow template import <file> --kind <kind> --out
  <folder>/<file>.json` writes the schema of any record kind into a template folder, naming its kind, and the next sync
  uses it with no step in the GUI; `capture` and `import` need no database
  ([Templates of one's own](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#templates-of-ones-own)).
- **`sqlflow template folders`** lists a working copy's template folders, and with `--for <document>` the templates a
  document reads and what a kind named alone settles to, with no database
  ([sqlflow template](osdu/docs/reference/cli/template.md#folders)).
- **The template a repository's document reads, from the API.** `GET /api/v1/delivery/templates/resolve` answers the
  template a document of a synced repository reads, or why none
  ([API](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/api.md#mappings-templates-and-the-mapping-builder)).

- **The sample is a complete package.** Beside its well logs, the welldb sample delivers the wells and wellbores they
  are logged in, each wellbore's directional survey (its stations to the Wellbore DDMS) and formation tops, and every
  OSDU reference value its records refer to, OSDU's own published values and the well database's own curve types, so it
  fills an empty partition with records whose references all resolve. Lineage orders it: the reference data, which puts
  what it delivers into the partition's cache as it runs, then wells, wellbores, logs and surveys, which bring the cache
  types they read up to date before they render. The reference values and the
  order are explained on [The OSDU order](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/osdu-order.md) and in the
  [sample](osdu/samples/welldb). The sample also reads OSDU back with every other kind of flow: assertions of the wells
  (their mapping's own `$assert` rule and known values), dimensions and a view over the logs, a weekly inventory, and a
  retrieval of the wellbores.
- **Lineage orders delivery flows by what their records refer to.** A delivery flow runs after the flows of its
  repository delivering the entity types its records refer to, as OSDU's schemas declare them, however its mapping writes
  the reference (a column, a literal, the cache or a search), and each repository sync warns where its waves cannot keep
  that order ([The OSDU order](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/osdu-order.md)).
- **The Order page.** Under Build, Delivery: which schedules run best before which, with how their next fires fall and the
  schedules that refer to each other in a circle; a partition's order level by level; and OSDU's lineage of any release
  of the OSDU data definitions, built on demand. The same is served under `/api/v1/delivery/order`
  ([The OSDU order](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/osdu-order.md#in-the-gui-and-the-api)).
- **A pipeline updates the cache before and after it runs.** A delivery flow's `cache` block names, by cache type or by
  OSDU entity type, what must be current before it renders (`before`) and what it brings up to date as it ends (`after`),
  so the pipelines after it in a schedule render against what it delivered; the run page shows what each step did
  ([cache](osdu/docs/reference/flow/delivery.md#cache)).
- **A record held for a missing reference comes back by itself.** Once the cache holds the record its reference names, by
  a refresh or a pipeline's cache step, the held record is released and planned again, a record delivered before
  included, under an activity naming the cache version
  ([The partition cache](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/partition-cache.md#a-record-held-for-a-reference-waits-for-it)).
- **A cache run can refresh some of its types.** Pick them in the run dialog, or name them in the payload's `types`; the
  rest of the partition's cache stays as it is ([Cache flow](osdu/docs/reference/flow/cache.md#operations-and-the-run-payload)).
- **Select an inventory's ids by what OSDU holds.** On an inventory's report, Filter takes the explorer's conditions on
  the records (a property, or a column of a source system): a match run of the inventory flow finds the ids that hold
  them, each tab counts its matching ids, the grid lists them with their values, and every matching orphan, stale or
  forgotten id can be removed at once, however many
  ([Selecting ids by what OSDU holds](osdu/docs/reference/flow/inventory-selections.md)).
- **The menu's sections fold, and the menu starts folded.** A click on a section's name in the side bar, such as Health
  or Flows, folds its entries away or brings them back. A browser opening the workbench for the first time shows every
  group and section folded to its name; from then on each starts as it was left
  ([The menu](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/menu.md)).

### Changed
- The Schedules page marks what a schedule runs its flows with by an icon, tinted when it gives an operation or values,
  with the values on hover and a click opening what each flow is given, so a schedule giving a list no longer widens the
  table into a sideways scroll ([The GUI](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/run-inputs.md#the-gui)).
- **The menu is grouped by what you do there.** SQLFlow's pages and OSDU Delivery's sit side by side in Operate, Ledger,
  OSDU, Build (Flows, Delivery, Sources), Explore, Admin and Settings, in place of Workspace, Tools and the OSDU group's
  sections: Subscribers is under Explore, Maintenance under Operate's Health, Datasources and Integrations under Build's
  Sources, and every page keeps its address ([The menu](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/menu.md)).
- An incremental load of a dimension that finds more than 250,000 records changed, or more than 250,000 keys to read
  again, loads in full, which reads a range at a time
  ([Full and incremental loads](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-incremental.md)). A running dimension build stages
  what it reads in tables of its own (`osdu.dimstage_*`), heaps loaded in bulk and dropped when the build ends, and a
  build whose staging was dropped under it (a later build took it for one its process left, or its dimension was
  removed) fails saying so and writes nothing
  ([A dimension build's staging](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-staging.md)).
- Dimension builds are much faster. Labels and attributes are read in batches sized by what the keys before them
  reached, two at a time, where a batch was sized for the most every key might reach, so a dimension of 160,000 wellbores
  reads its labels in a few hundred searches rather than tens of thousands; a build asks the search at most
  `recordsAtOnce` x `recordsAtOnce` requests at once, its dimensions together
  ([What a build holds](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-build.md#what-a-build-holds)). An incremental load writes and
  compares only the rows of the dimension's table whose keys it read again
  ([The dimension's table](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-table.md)). A view's check reads each row once, and a check
  is kept, not read again, when nothing the view reads changed since it ran; the Checks tab says **kept**
  ([Dimension views](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-views.md)).
- A delivery flow's `source.record.maxRecords` is the default its runs take rather than a ceiling: a run's payload
  `maxRecords` may now ask for more records than the document says, fewer, or 0 to read the whole scope, and a `replan`
  run takes it too; until now a payload could only ask for fewer
  ([The first records of the scope](osdu/docs/reference/flow/delivery.md#the-first-records-of-the-scope)).
- A flow's parameters, and a delivery flow's **Records at most**, moved from each kind's own trigger fields to the
  dialog's **Flow parameters** and **Run settings**, read from the flow's document; a delivery's `verify`, `drain`,
  `sync`, `reverse`, `undo`, `remove` and `delete-ledger` runs, which take no parameter values, ask for none
  ([Parameters](osdu/docs/reference/flow/parameters.md#in-the-gui-and-on-a-schedule)).
- The dimension flow's reference is a page per topic: `flow/dimension.md` holds the flow and its keys and links the pages
  that hold the rest (labels and attributes, elements, clean steps, the dimension's table, incremental loads, builds and
  errors), so a link to a section of the old page opens that section's own page
  ([Dimension flow](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension.md#the-pages-of-a-dimension-flow)).
- The Home page opens on the headline counts, without a heading, with the assistant's question box below them and then the delivery
  section, so what the estate is doing now is the first thing read.

- The automatic cleanup is configured as `ControlPlane:Maintenance:Enabled` and `ControlPlane:Maintenance:PollSeconds`;
  a control plane given `ControlPlane:RunTrace:*` refuses to start and names the new section, so move or remove those
  settings. Run events now take a limit like SQL statements, each pipeline's latest run and every failed run keeping
  theirs ([Maintenance](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/maintenance.md)).

- **Two ingestion trace steps run on the source and are named so.** An ingestion flow's source-minimum probe is traced as
  `source.incremental.min-probe` (was `incremental.min-probe`) and its match-keys read of the source's keys as
  `source.matchkeys.keys` (was `matchkeys.source-keys`), so lineage records their tables on the source; a query of the run
  statements by step name needs the new names
  ([observed tier](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/lineage-tiers.md#observed-the-latest-runjson-of-each-flow)).
- **A removal is a run of the flow, listed under Runs.** **Remove** on the Records tab and on a record's page queues a
  `remove` run of the pipeline, which shows under **Runs** with its trace and outcome, waits for a delivery of the
  pipeline that is running, and ends failed when OSDU refuses a record; the removal routes answer `runId` in place of
  `taskId`, and the `delivery-delete` node task is gone
  ([Removing records from OSDU](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/removal-and-reversal.md#removing-records-from-osdu)).
- **What runs at once is a flow's `parallelism` block, each key named for what it is; `reliability` keeps what makes a
  request hold.** A delivery flow writes `nodes`, `minRowsPerNode`, `recordsAtOnce`, `renderThreads`, `recordsPerBatch`
  and `interfacesAtOnce`. They were `fanOut` (which counted the parts beside the first run), `fanOutMinRecords`,
  `concurrency`, `renderers` (`reliability.renderParallelism` before), `batchRecords` and `interfaces`
  (`reliability.parallelInterfaces`), and `batchSize` is gone: retries are claimed `recordsAtOnce` at a time, at least
  50. An assertion, dimension, inventory or retrieval flow writes what one of its runs works on at once with the same
  `parallelism.recordsAtOnce` (it was `parallelism.concurrency`). A document that still writes an old name, or a setting under `reliability`, is refused, naming the key it is now: rename them in every flow
  when you upgrade ([parallelism](osdu/docs/reference/flow/delivery.md#parallelism)).
- **A large delivery is spread over the workers by default, each part on a worker of its own.** A run is split into a
  part per 1,000 rows it reads, up to `parallelism.nodes` (8 by default), so an incremental run of a few changed rows
  stays on one worker and a full delivery of thousands is spread over several. Each part is a run of the same flow that
  delivers its range of the primary key from a worker to itself, and the autoscaler starts a worker per part; the first
  run coordinates and closes the delivery. The flows need no change beyond the renamed keys: `source.work` stays a folder
  of each worker's own. `parallelism.nodes: 1` keeps a flow on one worker, and a flow without `source.record.primaryKey`,
  which the rows are split on, runs on one as before. `reliability.rateLimitRps` holds for the whole delivery, and each
  run's trace says why it was not split ([many nodes](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/submissions.md#many-nodes)).

- **`--set` repeated for one name gives it a list.** `--set logSource=A --set logSource=B` used to keep `B`; it now gives
  `logSource` both values, which only a delivery flow's scope parameter takes, and any other parameter refuses. Give a name
  once to give it one value ([sqlflow run](osdu/docs/reference/cli/run.md#the-kind-arguments)).

- **A source's Interfaces table fits its panel instead of scrolling sideways.** Why an interface goes by its route is on
  the route's hover, with a copy beside it; the kind takes the width the other columns leave, clipped from the left with
  the whole kind on hover and a copy beside it; and a long mapping name or list of interfaces waited for clips with the
  whole on hover ([A delivery flow's page](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#a-delivery-flows-page)).
- **A verify no longer calls a newer version drift when it holds the content the flow wrote.** Every write through the
  storage route records the hash of what it wrote, so a record another writer sent again unchanged, such as another
  instance of the delivery linked to it, is a match; records written before this change compare versions alone until
  their next write ([routes, storage](osdu/docs/reference/flow/routes.md#storage)).
- **The sign-in page says what OSDU Delivery is for, and is set on the brand's navy.** In place of four paragraphs of
  features, it shows the README's pitch in two lines and one sentence, a picture of the kinds of data it delivers
  (wells, logs, seismic, documents, production data and more) flowing into OSDU, the "powered by SQLFlow" lockup, and the
  sign-in form, in both themes ([The GUI](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md)).
- **The side bar's menu is a tree.** Each group is a branch, each section a branch under its group and each entry a
  leaf under its section, every level indented under the one above with a guide line, and a
  group's and a section's name the same size as its entries. Tab enters the menu at the page shown, the arrow keys move
  through it and fold or unfold a branch, and Enter opens a page
  ([The menu](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/menu.md)).
- **The explorer reads a partition through the partition's own connection, and needs no flow.** It signs in with the
  platform and client the deployment names for the partition (`OSDU_URL`, `OSDU_TOKEN_URL`, `OSDU_SCOPE`,
  `OSDU_CLIENT_ID` and `OSDU_CLIENT_SECRET`, from `Osdu:Partitions:<id>:Properties` or the control plane's environment,
  naming any that is missing), so a deployment can be searched before a flow is synced;
  `GET /api/v1/delivery/explorer/connection` answers the `endpoint` it reaches in place of the borrowed flow's `through`
  and `route` ([The explorer](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/explorer.md#how-it-reaches-osdu)).
- **`sqlflow dev setup` offers a GitHub App for a GitHub repository before a token.** It asks for the App's client ID
  and the path of its `.pem` file, and `sqlflow dev check` reports an App that is only half configured; Enter at the new
  question keeps the token as before ([dev](osdu/docs/reference/cli/dev.md)).
- **The compose stacks give the control plane the git credentials too.** A repository registered there with no
  credential reference now syncs with `SQLFLOW_GITHUB_APP_*` or `SQLFLOW_GIT_TOKEN` from `.env`, as the worker already
  checked out with them ([deployment](osdu/docs/reference/guides/deployment.md)).
- **Documents read their templates from the repository, not from the saved templates.** A mapping, its searches, an
  assertion test and a dimension read the template they fill from the template folders on their path, and a run,
  `sqlflow check`, lineage and the sync do too; a mapping whose template no folder on its path holds no longer loads,
  and the sync says where it looked, and a record rendered for a version no folder holds any longer is `unverified`.
  For an estate whose templates were saved in the module's
  database, make each version its documents pin a file in a template folder before upgrading: download a version a
  release publishes on Browse OSDU, or write it with `sqlflow template capture --release <tag> --out <folder>/<file>.json`;
  read one of your own from the running control plane with `GET /api/v1/delivery/templates/schema?kind=&version=` and
  write it with `sqlflow template import <file> --kind <kind> --out <folder>/<file>.json`; every pin keeps its version
  ([Upgrading an estate](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#upgrading-an-estate-that-saved-templates-in-the-database)).
- **The Templates page lists the templates the synced repositories hold.** Its Repositories tab lists every file of
  every synced repository's template folders, read from the file, in place of the saved versions; a link naming a kind
  and version opens the file holding it. `GET /api/v1/delivery/templates` answers those files, and
  `GET /api/v1/delivery/templates/detail` and `/schema` name one by `repoId` and `path` instead of `kind` and `version`
  ([The GUI](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#templates), [API](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/api.md#mappings-templates-and-the-mapping-builder)).
- **The mapping builder starts from a template a repository holds.** It offers the files of the picked repository's
  template folders and proposes the mapping alone, into the `mappings` folder beside the one holding its template;
  `POST /api/v1/delivery/mapping-builder/draft` takes `repoId` and `templatePath` instead of `kind` and `version`
  ([The GUI](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#mapping-builder)).
- **The explorer checks a record against a repository's template.** Validation's **Saved template** is now
  **Repository template**: `schema` takes `template` instead of `saved` on the validate routes, and an answer lists the
  versions the repositories hold in `templateVersions` instead of `savedVersions`
  ([Explorer](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/explorer.md#validate)).
- **The MCP server's template tools read the repositories.** `delivery_templates` lists the template files and lays one
  out by `repoId` and `path` instead of `kind` and `version`, and `delivery_scaffold_mapping` takes `repoId` and
  `templatePath` ([The MCP server](osdu/docs/reference/guides/mcp.md)).
- **`sqlflow template capture` and `import` require `--out`.** A template is a file, so both write one and save nothing
  in a database ([sqlflow template](osdu/docs/reference/cli/template.md)).
- **The decision records and the pattern catalog are pages of the wiki.** They moved to
  [osdu/docs/wiki](osdu/docs/wiki/index.md), in SQLFlow's wiki format, and the MCP server knows them by new ids:
  `delivery-wiki-0014-inventory-removals` for what was `delivery-decision-0014`, and `delivery-wiki-pattern-catalog` for
  `delivery-guide-pattern-catalog`; an old id finds nothing, so search for the page instead.
- **A repository's waves can change at its next sync.** Flows that referred to each other only by ids written from
  columns or literals now run in the order of what they refer to, and a delivery checked against a cache whose flow also
  captures what it delivers now runs before that cache flow rather than unordered against it. Schedules keep their
  members; their fires run them in the new waves ([Lineage](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/lineage.md#how-the-nodes-order-flows)).

- **The sample estate's lookup tables and reference records cover the sample's own curves.** The welldb curve
  dictionary lists the mnemonics the five sample logs carry and one spelling filed under another, the unit table the
  spellings those curves use, and the sample reference records the units, curve types and families they name, so the
  example reads as one small, consistent set ([Sample cache records](osdu/samples/cache-records/README.md)).
- **A Radix environment is complete in its configuration.** `radixconfig.yaml` names the workers' credential (the
  vault's `node-token`, generated before the first deploy in SQLFlow's token form) and the flow repository, as the
  Terraform estate does, so the control plane adopts the one and registers the other when it starts, and nothing is
  minted or registered by hand after the first deploy; `git-token` is read as a reference by both tiers rather than
  mounted. An environment deployed before this mints nothing new: store its token as `node-token` and add the
  repository's settings ([Setting up a Radix environment](osdu/docs/reference/guides/radix-setup.md)).

- **The Tests page is the Assertions page.** The GUI calls each test of an assertion flow an assertion, as the flow
  type names them, and each of its assertions a check: the page, a flow's tab, the board, the sheet, the run dialog
  (whose operation reads **Check**) and the reports say so. Flow documents, the API and the CLI keep `tests:`,
  `assert:` and the `test` operation ([The GUI](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#osdu)).
- **The board says what an assertion's document says now.** A disabled assertion shows its reason, one whose proof
  values are past their day shows that it needs new proof values, the Definition tab says where the schema comes from
  and how long the proof values hold, and a skipped result no longer reads as an error
  ([The GUI](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#osdu)).
- **A local start runs its work in workers, as a deployment does.** `dev.bat` and `./dev.sh` start the control plane
  with managed workers: worker processes it starts for queued runs and lets leave when idle, so Spawn, Always on and the
  target act on the Nodes page here too. `dev.bat single` (`./dev.sh single`) is the one-process start that ran by
  default before, and `managed` still names the default
  ([Managed workers on a developer's machine](osdu/docs/reference/guides/managed-workers.md#on-a-developers-machine-devbat)).
- **The Nodes page answers one question per tab.** A line of four facts (workers online, runs running, runs queued and
  how many could start, how workers start) opens on Workers (the nodes), Scaling (the pools and their controls, and the
  managed workers), Queue (what runs, what is queued and the gate holding it) and, with managed workers on, Activity
  (what the control plane started and stopped, and why); explanations sit behind an info mark instead of paragraphs
  ([Managed workers](osdu/docs/reference/guides/managed-workers.md#watching-it)).
- **The Nodes page says when nothing starts workers.** With managed workers off and the control plane running runs on
  its own node (`dev.bat single`, F5), Worker pools names that node and shows a pool short of its target as below target
  rather than starting, and Spawn and Always on say they only record a target
  ([The control plane](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md)).

### Added

- **Proof values of records found by what they hold.** An assertion flow's `knownValues` finds each record a sheet
  describes by full paths in the OSDU record and values, including lists of paths up to the record a reference names
  (`'[data.WellboreID, data.FacilityName]'`, as a dimension's label reads) and down to the records naming one, then
  holds it to the sheet's proof values,
  saying row by row which hold, which differ, which are not found and which are found twice
  ([Known values](osdu/docs/reference/flow/known-values.md)).
- **Tests switched off, and proof values that hold for a while.** A test, an assertion, a row of known values or a proof
  value takes `disabled: <why>` and is reported as skipped with its reason. A test or an assertion says when its values
  were stated (`asOf`) and how long they hold (`validFor: 90d`, or `validUntil`); past that it is not judged and is
  flagged as needing new proof values, a warning on the board. `asOfField: createTime` compares only the records OSDU had
  created by that day
  ([Disabling a test](osdu/docs/reference/flow/assertion.md#disabling-a-test-and-the-day-its-values-hold-until)).
- **Numbers a little off warn rather than fail.** A `count`, an `aggregate` or a known value's proof value takes
  `warnWithin: 10%` (or a distance, `warnWithin: 5`): a number that misses by no more is a warning, so its test is warned
  rather than failed, and the result says by how much it missed
  ([A warning band](osdu/docs/reference/flow/assertion.md#a-warning-band)).
- **A test names its template by the mapping.** `template: WellLog@1.5.0` checks a test against the template that
  mapping fills, so a test reads as the delivery does and follows the mapping when it moves to another version; a
  template version (`template: 2f8a99cb38d32480`) is taken as before ([Tests](osdu/docs/reference/flow/assertion.md#tests)).
- **Aggregates that leave values out.** An aggregate's `except` lists values it does not count, such as a log's index
  curve `MD` among its curves ([Assertions](osdu/docs/reference/flow/assertion.md#assertions)).

### Removed
- `POST /api/v1/delivery/ledger/prune` is gone: set a limit for, or clean up, the areas `osdu.attempts`,
  `osdu.activity-logs` and `osdu.assertion-runs` on the Maintenance page or through `/api/v1/maintenance/areas/{areaId}`,
  and retire any scheduled job that called the old route
  ([What the osdu schema stores](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/storage-and-retention.md)).
- The Maintenance page's Purge all buttons and the routes `GET /api/v1/maintenance/trace-storage`,
  `PUT /api/v1/maintenance/statement-retention`, `POST /api/v1/maintenance/statements/purge` and
  `POST /api/v1/maintenance/events/purge`; `/api/v1/maintenance/storage` and the storage-area routes replace them, and a
  limit set for the SQL statements carries over ([Maintenance](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/maintenance.md)).

- **The module's second database connection, `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB`.** The `osdu` schema lives in the catalog's database and
  every tier reaches it through `SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB`, worker nodes included: give each node `SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB` in place
  of `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB`. `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB`, `Osdu:Database:Connection`, the Terraform's `osdu_database_name` and the Bicep's
  `osduDatabaseName` are no longer read, and a deployment that still sets them starts and deploys as before, ignoring
  them; an estate that kept the `osdu` schema in a database of its own brings it into the catalog's database before
  upgrading ([where the osdu schema lives](osdu/docs/reference/cli/db.md#where-it-lives)). A worker whose settings
  still give `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB` and not `SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB` reads the catalog's connection from it, with a warning, until
  its settings change ([the worker](osdu/docs/reference/cli/worker.md#the-module-database-sqlflow_catalog_db)).
- **The library of saved templates.** The Templates page's Saved and Import file tabs, **Save template** and **Delete**,
  `POST` and `DELETE /api/v1/delivery/templates`, and `sqlflow template list`, `show` and `delete` are gone, and the
  upgrade's migration drops `[osdu].[Template]` with every version saved in it. Make each version an estate's documents
  pin a file in a template folder before upgrading, as **Documents read their templates from the repository** above
  says ([Upgrading an estate](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/templates.md#upgrading-an-estate-that-saved-templates-in-the-database)).

### Fixed
- East of UTC, a record's page said a lease its worker still renewed had run out, at a time still to come, and west of
  UTC it showed a stopped worker as still delivering; an assertion run's, a retrieval's and a release's times were off by
  the same offset. The GUI read the UTC times the control plane sends without a zone as local time, and now reads them
  as UTC ([Records are stuck in delivering](osdu/docs/reference/guides/operations-runbook.md#records-are-stuck-in-delivering)).
- Builds of two dimensions running at once could deadlock, failing one of them as the victim, or wait for each other:
  SQL Server locked the pages where one dimension's rows meet the next, and a check before each write
  read every dimension's row. Each build now locks only its own rows
  ([What a build does](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-build.md#what-a-build-does)).

- **A dimension build no longer runs out of memory.** A build held everything it read until it wrote, so a large
  dimension (a wellbore dimension with nine attributes read through references) failed with an `OutOfMemoryException`
  however much memory its worker had. A build now stages what it reads in the module's database as it reads it, and reads
  labels and attributes a bounded batch of keys at a time, so what it holds no longer grows with its dimension; what it
  writes is unchanged ([What a build holds](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-build.md#what-a-build-holds)).
- **A key no query can carry no longer fails its dimension.** A key, or a reference a label or an attribute reads,
  holding a control character failed the whole dimension; it now has no label (or no such attribute), and the build's
  notes say why ([Reading through steps](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-attributes.md#reading-through-steps)).
- **A repository's folders stay shut until they are opened.** Opening a project on a repo's page or the Pipelines page
  unfolded every folder holding a flow, with every file beside it, so an estate keeping thousands of files beside its
  flows (a data drop, a folder per well) listed them all. A project now opens onto its top-level folders, each opening
  one level at a time; a search opens only the folders on the way to what it matched, and a project it matches by name
  opens with its folders shut
  ([What a repository holds, and its page](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md#what-a-repository-holds-and-its-page)).
- **A flow's dimensions build beside each other without deadlocking, and so does a dimension in two partitions.** A
  dimension building while others did could fail as a deadlock victim, most often in a new estate's first build; each
  dimension's rows are now kept together and a build reads only its own, and a dimension's own table keeps each
  partition's rows together. The upgrade rebuilds the dimension tables once, and each dimension's own table on its next
  build, taking time and log space in proportion to their size
  ([How the tables are keyed](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/database.md#how-the-tables-are-keyed),
  [the dimension's table](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-table.md)).
- **The catalog's Databases branch shows each database once.** A database spelled two ways, or reached through two
  connection references, was two nodes; it is now one, in the spelling most of its objects carry, and each folder lists
  exactly the objects it counts. Objects whose database a sync could not work out are grouped under the connection
  reference they were reached through, saying how to give them one, where they used to be one "(unresolved)" node that
  listed every database's objects; `databaseUnknown` and `schemaUnknown` ask the lineage and semantic-layer object lists
  for them ([lineage read API](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md#lineage-read-api)).
- **The catalog no longer lists the platform's own tables as data.** A flow reading or writing the catalog's database
  (a dimension flow's views, say) made a connected sync list every table of the catalog and of the delivery ledger; they
  are left out, unless a flow reads one
  ([the derived tier](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/lineage-tiers.md#derived-connected-catalog-inventory-and-module-harvest)).
- **The catalog forgets objects nothing knows any more.** A dropped view, a renamed table, or the objects of a connection
  reference no flow names any more stayed listed for good; a sync now removes them once nothing references them, while
  what a flow, a report model or a person's curation refers to stays
  ([lineage projection](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/shadow-catalog.md#lineage-projection-global-objects-repo-scoped-edges-waves)).
- **The catalog's Flows branch lists only the flows still in their repositories.** A flow removed from its repository
  kept its row in the tree; its run history is still on its pipeline's page.
- **A dimension flow's pipeline names the connection it writes its tables and views on.** It showed `file` as its target,
  so the connections page did not count it among the connection's users
  ([lineage, the GUI and the cache](osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension.md#lineage-the-gui-and-the-cache)).
- **Delivery, cache, dimension, assertion, inventory and ingestion runs say how long they took.** Their duration was
  never recorded, so their runs showed when they ran but not for how long; the catalog migration gives the runs already
  recorded theirs from their own start and end
  ([how long a run took](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/shadow-catalog.md#how-long-a-run-took)).
- **Removing every record of a listing narrowed to an issue removes only that issue's records.** **Select all N
  matching**, then **Remove**, on a Records tab opened from the Issues tab took out of OSDU every record the rest of the
  filter matched, not just those the issue keeps blocked; the removal now carries the whole filter, and refuses one that
  matches more than 25,000 records when it runs as well as when it is asked
  ([Removing records from OSDU](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/removal-and-reversal.md#removing-records-from-osdu)).
- **A run no longer fails when another stages records built from the same cached values at the same moment.** Two
  runs, or two parts of a split delivery, could both record the same combination of cached values, and the second
  failed on a duplicate key of `osdu.CacheSet`; it now uses the set the first recorded
  ([osdu.CacheSet](osdu/docs/reference/tables/cache-set.md#written-and-read-by)).
- **A split delivery never waits for ever on parts no worker starts, and survives one that fails.** A first run whose
  parts stay queued for three minutes on a pool with no place free stops them and delivers their rows itself, as it does
  the rows of a part that failed ([many nodes](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/submissions.md#many-nodes)).
- **A work batch file that is gone no longer fails the run.** A drain that cannot find a batch file, or finds a line of it
  that is no work item, sends the rest and leaves those records to be planned again by the flow's next run
  ([work batches](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/submissions.md#work-batches)).
- **A submission planned again no longer writes over the batch files its queued records read from.** A record retried
  after its submission was planned again could read another record's document from a rewritten batch file; a new plan
  now writes its batches after the old ones, and a record whose line is not its own is held and planned again from its
  row ([work batches](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/submissions.md#work-batches)).

- **A storage account reached only over its Data Lake endpoint works.** The landing storage, work and known-state
  locations and every other Azure Storage location are read and written over the account's Blob or Data Lake (`dfs`)
  endpoint, whichever the deployment's network reaches, so a network with a private endpoint for `dfs` alone no longer
  fails with `403 AuthorizationFailure`; `SQLFLOW_AZURE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` fixes the choice
  ([Azure Storage endpoints](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/azure-storage-endpoints.md)).
- **A write OSDU skips as unchanged lands at the version OSDU holds.** With `skipDuplicates`, the ledger recorded the
  version it last knew for a skipped record, which another writer may have moved, and recorded a skipped record OSDU held
  soft-deleted as delivered while OSDU served nothing; the route now reads the version, and brings such a record back
  under its id ([routes, storage](osdu/docs/reference/flow/routes.md#storage)).
- **The audit trail narrows to inventory repairs and new OSDU ids.** Its action filter now offers `inventory-repair` and
  `reassign-id`, which the trail records, beside the new `adopt` ([Audit trail](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/gui.md#audit-trail)).
- **Shift+Tab leaves a tree.** In the catalog, a repository's folders, the AI context tables and a template's
  variables, Shift+Tab from a row sent focus straight back into the tree, so the keyboard could not leave it backwards;
  it now steps out, and the schema changes tree can be reached with Tab at all
  ([The menu](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/menu.md)).
- **Runs that finish together no longer deadlock in the catalog.** When a schedule's members ended at once, as a set
  of failing assertion flows does, each completion waited on the others and the control plane's log filled with failed
  commands and deadlock victims. Every read on a connection a catalog or ledger write had used also ran serializable,
  so the dispatcher's checks and the GUI's reads became victims too. Each connection now goes back to the pool at read
  committed, and a completion writes what follows from it once it has committed
  ([The control plane](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md#the-dispatcher)).
- **A page left while it loads is not logged as a failure.** A request the browser abandoned while its database read
  ran was logged as three errors, the first "A severe error occurred on the current command"; it now ends as the
  client's cancellation, logged at debug ([The control plane](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md)).
- **An inventory's grid keeps its footer in view when ids are picked.** The bar that says what is picked made the grid
  taller than the window, so its last rows and its footer went below the page's edge; the grid now shrinks to make room.
- **A cache flow's run dialog no longer offers Force,** which a cache run refuses: a refresh captures every type it is
  given in full ([Cache flow](osdu/docs/reference/flow/cache.md#operations-and-the-run-payload)).
- **A Radix environment delivers every flow.** The Radix application set only the LogType flow's access groups, so
  every other delivery flow, which reads `OSDU_ACL_OWNER` and `OSDU_ACL_VIEWER` unless it sets its own, could not
  resolve its groups; each partition now sets both, and the setup guide's SQL creates the `osdu` schema before it grants
  the worker's rights on it ([Setting up a Radix environment](osdu/docs/reference/guides/radix-setup.md)).

- **The Nodes page opens while managed workers run.** Each worker's state reached the page as a number rather than its
  name, so the page went blank as soon as a managed worker was listed, locally and on Radix; it now shows each worker
  as starting, ready, leaving and so on ([Managed workers](osdu/docs/reference/guides/managed-workers.md#watching-it)).
- **Local managed workers start when the osdu schema is in the catalog's database.** A setup with no `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB`
  of its own, as `.sqlflow/env` usually is, started workers that exited at once ("exited with code 1 before its first
  poll"); each worker is now handed the module database the control plane uses, and no setting needs adding
  ([Managed workers on a developer's machine](osdu/docs/reference/guides/managed-workers.md#on-a-developers-machine-devbat)).
- **A tolerance is the number written.** A `tolerance` with few decimals, such as `0.0005`, was read as
  0.000500000024, which let a value a hair further off hold and showed that number in reports; it is now compared and
  shown as written. A test with such a tolerance is shown as changed once, until it runs again
  ([Conditions](osdu/docs/reference/flow/assertion.md#conditions)).
- **A worker pool asks only for workers that would get a run.** A schedule fire's members beyond its `maxConcurrency`,
  and a second queued run of a flow, counted as demand until the first started, so Azure and Kubernetes started workers
  that found nothing to run and were scaled away again. The target now counts what the pool's workers would start, and
  the Nodes page marks the members waiting their turn as at the group cap
  ([Deployment](sqlflow/docs/reference/guides/deployment.md)).

### Security
- Setting a limit and cleaning up on the Maintenance page need the admin scope; until now any signed-in user could change
  the SQL statements' retention and delete every statement and run event
  ([Maintenance](sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/maintenance.md)).

- **A GitHub token quoted in an error is redacted before it is logged or shown,** in every format GitHub issues, and a
  resolved git credential never prints its secret.
- **An unzip cannot write outside its target.** An archive names its entries itself, and on an Azure Blob or S3 target
  an entry such as `../x` landed beside the target folder. A copy flow now fails with `escapes the target root` on any
  target when an archive entry, or a source object's key, would leave it
  ([Copy flow](sqlflow/docs/reference/flow/cpy.md#operations)).
- **No dependency with a known advisory.** System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs resolves at 10.0.13, past the .NET denial
  of service advisories CVE-2026-84008 and CVE-2026-70162, and the GUI's dompurify at 3.4.17, past its two DOM XSS
  advisories.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-19

Module schema 1.46.0 and SQLFlow `fe87877c`, as in 1.0.0; the one change to `sqlflow/` since is to its tests
([docs/sqlflow-changes.md](docs/sqlflow-changes.md)).

### Changed

- **A local start installs the pre-push tests.** In a git clone with no hooks path set, a start of `dev.bat` or
  `./dev.sh` points git at `tools/git-hooks`, whose pre-push runs the unit tests (`bash tools/test.sh`) before every
  push; `git push --no-verify` skips it once and `git config --unset core.hooksPath` removes it
  ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#tests)).
- **A start without .NET offers to install it, on every platform.** `dev.bat` offers winget, and `./dev.sh`
  Homebrew on a Mac and Microsoft's `dotnet-install.sh` into `~/.dotnet` on Linux; then the setup is built from the
  checkout as on any start ([osdu-delivery-setup](osdu/docs/reference/cli/dev.md)).

### Removed

- **The setup's binaries.** A release no longer carries `osdu-delivery-setup` for each platform, and the launchers
  no longer download one: they build it from the checkout, in seconds, once .NET is there. A release is its tag and
  its notes ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releases)).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-18

The first release of OSDU Delivery, powered by SQLFlow: subsurface data delivered into an OSDU platform by
configuration rather than code, with every record traceable in a ledger. The [README](README.md) says what it is and the
[reference documentation](osdu/docs/reference/README.md) describes what it does. This log starts at this release.

### Added

- **Delivery as configuration.** A pre-ingestion flow lands source files, an ingestion flow loads them into a table
  keyed by record with the source file and row of each row, and an OSDU flow delivers from that table; lineage orders
  the three. A mapping turns one row into one record of a saved OSDU template, with lookups, expressions, conditions and
  business rules ([flow/mapping.md](osdu/docs/reference/flow/mapping.md)).
- **Every OSDU write path.** The Storage, File and Dataset services, manifest and workflow ingestion, and the Wellbore,
  Seismic, Rock and Fluid Samples, Well Delivery, Production and Reservoir domain data stores, with their files and bulk
  data ([docs/osdu-coverage-plan.md](docs/osdu-coverage-plan.md)).
- **A cache per data partition.** Reference data captured from OSDU, lookup tables from files, databases and ingestion
  tables, and dictionaries kept in the repository, held as versions that mappings read
  ([concepts/partition-cache.md](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/partition-cache.md)).
- **Only what changed is sent.** The same source row always becomes the same OSDU record, a run sends only the records
  that render differently, and a change of mapping, template or cache sends exactly the records it affects
  ([concepts/change-detection.md](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/change-detection.md)).
- **The delivery ledger.** Each record's source row, the mapping, template and cache versions that rendered it, every
  attempt and what OSDU answered, the OSDU id and version it landed as, and every operator action with who and when;
  statistics count from it, and a record is found by its key, OSDU id or source file
  ([concepts/ledger.md](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/ledger.md)).
- **Checked before sending.** `sqlflow check`, `preview` and `plan`; mappings are checked against their schema, legal
  tags are confirmed with OSDU, and each document is validated before it goes out, its verdict recorded.
- **Safe when things fail, and correctable.** A run resumes from its last recorded step, problems that need a person are
  held for release, and a delivery that fails halfway is undone. Records are redelivered, removed, restored to their
  previous version, or a whole run reversed, each through the ledger
  ([concepts/removal-and-reversal.md](osdu/docs/reference/concepts/removal-and-reversal.md)).
- **After delivery.** Verify and reconcile against OSDU, inventory flows that find orphans and records OSDU lost,
  retrieval of OSDU records into files, dimension flows, data quality tests, and an explorer of what OSDU holds.
- **The GUI and the command line.** The workbench pages for records, flows, the cache, mappings, tests and the audit
  trail, a mapping builder and a YAML editor that documents and checks every document, and `sqlflow` verbs for the same.
- **A local run set up by answering questions.** `dev.bat` (Windows) and `./dev.sh` (macOS, Linux) set a machine up on
  its first start: `osdu-delivery-setup` asks for the SQL Server (starting SQL Server 2022 in Docker where there is
  none), the OSDU platform and its client, and a flow repository, writes `.sqlflow/env` from `dev.env.example`, creates
  the databases and registers the partition. Every start then reports each tool, setting and database with its fix,
  and stops only when a start would fail. The release carries the setup for Windows, macOS and Linux, so a machine
  without .NET runs it too and is offered the install ([Run it locally](osdu/docs/reference/guides/run-locally.md),
  [osdu-delivery-setup](osdu/docs/reference/cli/dev.md)).
- **An AI assistant.** `osdu-delivery-mcp` serves Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, Slack and the GUI's chat from metadata
  and documentation, and answers questions over data only through AI contexts an admin approves
  ([guides/mcp.md](osdu/docs/reference/guides/mcp.md)).
- **Deployment.** A control plane, workers that fetch their work, the GUI and the MCP server, over two SQL Server
  databases, with Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Bicep, Terraform and Radix templates; dev, test and prod environments
  deployed from GitHub, each with its OSDU partitions in its configuration
  ([osdu/deploy/README.md](osdu/deploy/README.md)).
- **Ready to use when a deployment ends.** The Terraform (and its Bicep mirror) sets the whole Azure estate up from its
  configuration alone: the deployment generates the JWT signing key, the initial admin's password and the node
  credential into the vault, creates the apps' database users, and the control plane applies the partitions,
  databases, landing storage and flow repositories the configuration names at every start, in a start-up pass reported
  at `/health/startup`. A person puts in the vault only each partition's client secret and each private repository's
  token, and no secret reaches the Terraform. An environment's two files can be kept outside the repository, on a
  workstation (`OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_DIR`) or in its GitHub environment, so the committed ones stay placeholders.
- **Its own database schema.** Every OSDU table lives in the `osdu` schema under its own migrations: module schema
  1.46.0 (migration `20261014094057_PurgedRecordReadAgain`), requiring SQLFlow catalog migration
  `20261014215105_RunSuppliedReferences` or later. The hosts refuse to run against pending migrations.
- **Built on SQLFlow** `fe87877c` ([github.com/TahirRiaz/SQLFlow](https://github.com/TahirRiaz/SQLFlow)),
  vendored in `sqlflow/` with the extension points and fixes this project needed, each recorded with its reason
  ([docs/sqlflow-changes.md](docs/sqlflow-changes.md)). It runs on .NET 9, with every package on its newest release
  for it.

### Security

- Secrets are references only (`${env:NAME}`, `${keyvault:...}`): a document holding a literal secret is refused when it
  is read, and errors are redacted before they are stored or shown.
