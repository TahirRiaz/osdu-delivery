#  OSDU Delivery local dev, on macOS and Linux (dev.bat on Windows). Run this instead of deploying to try something.
#
#      ./dev.sh          start the GUI, the control plane and its managed workers: worker processes the control plane
#                        starts and stops itself (the 'process' launcher), as a deployment's workers run, so the Nodes
#                        page's scaling acts here too
#      ./dev.sh api      control plane and workers only (no GUI, so no Node.js needed)
#      ./dev.sh single   one process: the control plane runs runs on its own node and starts no worker processes (what
#                        F5 runs). Combine with api: ./dev.sh single api
#      ./dev.sh managed  the default, accepted as before
#      ./dev.sh setup    ask the setup questions again (the SQL Server, OSDU, a repository), then start
#      ./dev.sh check    say what this machine has and what it is missing, test the OSDU sign-in, and start nothing
#
#  First start: with no .sqlflow/env yet, the setup asks for what it cannot know, offers to create the databases and to
#  start SQL Server 2022 in Docker (which is how SQL Server runs on a Mac), writes .sqlflow/env from dev.env.example, and
#  registers the partition. Every start then checks the machine and the file and prints what is set and what is missing,
#  with the fix for each, and stops only when a start would fail. Both are osdu-delivery-setup
#  (osdu/docs/reference/cli/dev.md), built here from this checkout in seconds; on a machine without .NET, which every
#  start needs, this script offers to install it first. It only finds them, and starts what the check cleared.
#
#  What comes up: the GUI on http://localhost:5173 (Vite, hot-reloads on save), the control plane on
#  http://localhost:5000 (API + scheduler + dispatcher; with 'single', its own node too), and the worker processes it
#  starts, named worker-<pool>-<id>, at least one and at most 4 unless .sqlflow/env sets
#  ControlPlane__ManagedWorkers__MaxWorkers, all in this terminal: Ctrl+C stops them.
#  Everything runs here, against the databases and the OSDU partition .sqlflow/env names; flows read and WRITE them
#  exactly as a deployed estate does. Pending migrations from THIS checkout are applied before startup.
#
#  Written for the bash macOS ships (3.2): no ${var,,}, no associative arrays, no empty-array expansion under set -u.
