# OSDU Delivery - Project Instructions

## Project Identity

**This project is OSDU Delivery, powered by SQLFlow: a metadata-driven system that publishes subsurface records (wells, wellbores, well logs, and the other OSDU kinds) into an OSDU platform, with per-record traceability.** It is a separate project. It is NOT DeltaForge, and it is not SQLFlow.

- SQLFlow is the engine underneath, vendored in `sqlflow/` as this project's own copy. OSDU Delivery is a module on top of it, in `osdu/`: the OSDU flow kind, the delivery ledger, the protocols, mappings, templates, the OSDU cache, the OSDU GUI pages, and the hosts that compose SQLFlow with the module.
- The product name shown in the GUI, the CLI banner, and the docs is "OSDU Delivery". Where the product introduces itself (the login page, the workbench title bar, the CLI banner, the README) it carries the lockup "OSDU Delivery, powered by SQLFlow". Prose, page titles and notification subjects keep the short name. The `SqlFlow.*` project, namespace, binary, image and environment-variable names are kept on purpose.
- Data reaches OSDU through SQLFlow's own flows: a pre-ingestion flow lands source files, an ingestion (`ing`) flow loads the keyed ingestion tables, and the OSDU flow reads those tables and delivers to OSDU. Lineage orders the three like any other flows. There is no drop manifest, no drop reader and no replica: do not reintroduce them.
- The documentation is the reference corpus in `osdu/docs/reference/` (in SQLFlow's format, beside SQLFlow's own in `sqlflow/docs/reference/`) and the decision records in `osdu/docs/decisions/`. What ships is documented there, and code cites those pages. Design documents and plans are not kept in the repository; `docs/` holds only records: `docs/osdu-coverage-plan.md` (which OSDU kinds, services and DDMS the engine covers), `docs/sqlflow-changes.md` and `docs/sqlflow-upstream-candidates.md`.
- The previous implementation at `D:\Projects\eq\src\osdu-delivery` is the reference the OSDU code was copied from; it is not edited from here.
- The `deltaforge` MCP server and its documentation describe a different system. Verify behaviour against the source in this repository.
- OSDU API behaviour (storage, search, legal, entitlements, schema, delete and purge, and every DDMS) is verified against the contracts pinned in `osdu/specs`, never from memory: the core set is copied from `D:\Projects\eq\src\osdu-csharp-client-main\openapi_specs`, and `tools/vendor-osdu-specs.js` fetches the DDMS set. Where a contract is silent, check the service's own source on community.opengroup.org.

## The Vendored SQLFlow: Generic Extension Points Only

**All work happens in this repository. The SQLFlow repository, `B:\SQLFlow` (github.com/TahirRiaz/SQLFlow), is changed from here only when the user asks for this project's changes to `sqlflow/` to be carried to it.** `sqlflow/` is a squashed git subtree of SQLFlow, and this project changes it only to add the generic extension points the OSDU module needs.

- **Generic only.** A change to `sqlflow/` is an extension point any module could use (a flow kind registry, an executor fallback, run parameters, a module database, a GUI module contract, a lineage contributor, branding). No OSDU code, name, table or wording ever goes into `sqlflow/`; the OSDU side of every extension point lives in `osdu/`.
- **Its own commits.** Every commit that changes `sqlflow/` touches nothing outside it, and its subject starts with `sqlflow:`. The OSDU work that uses an extension point is a separate commit.
- **SQLFlow's standards apply inside `sqlflow/`.** A catalog change ships with its EF Core migration, the SQLFlow solution builds with zero warnings, SQLFlow's existing flow kinds keep their behaviour, and SQLFlow's own suites pass, with new tests for each extension point.
- **Updates.** SQLFlow improvements come in with `git subtree pull --prefix=sqlflow --squash B:/SQLFlow master` on a branch of their own, as one reviewable commit. Conflicts can only arise in the files this project changed in `sqlflow/` since the last pull ([docs/sqlflow-changes.md](docs/sqlflow-changes.md) lists them); resolve them keeping both SQLFlow's change and this project's. A subtree pull is a merge commit, which `main`'s linear history does not admit, so the user lands it ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-the-vendored-sqlflow)).
- `tools/check-vendored-sqlflow.sh` names the SQLFlow commit `sqlflow/` was vendored from, lists every file changed here since, and fails when a commit mixes `sqlflow/` with other paths or when a line added to `sqlflow/` mentions OSDU or the delivery module. It must pass before work is handed back, and CI's Conventions job runs it.
- **Every change to `sqlflow/` is recorded in [docs/sqlflow-changes.md](docs/sqlflow-changes.md)**: what it is, why it was made, and whether it is an extension point or a fix upstream wants regardless. A new `sqlflow:` commit adds its row there.
- A fix made in `osdu/` to code that was copied from SQLFlow, where SQLFlow has the same weakness, is recorded in [docs/sqlflow-upstream-candidates.md](docs/sqlflow-upstream-candidates.md).

## The OSDU Database Schema, Migrations And Version

**Every OSDU table, view and index lives in the dedicated `osdu` schema, owned by the module's own EF Core context, with its own migration history and its own schema version. SQLFlow's catalog model never contains an OSDU table, and OSDU never changes SQLFlow's tables.**

- The migration history table is `[osdu].[__EFMigrationsHistory]`; migrations live in the module's data project, never in SQLFlow's.
- **Every change to the OSDU model ships with its migration.** A new entity, column, length or index is incomplete until its migration, designer file and refreshed model snapshot are committed together. There is no re-minting of databases.
- `[osdu].[SchemaVersion]` records the module's schema version, the last migration applied, when and by whom, and the minimum SQLFlow catalog migration it requires. The hosts and `sqlflow db status` refuse to run against pending OSDU migrations, a database newer than the code, or a SQLFlow catalog older than required, and name the migration or version in the message.
- **The one exception: a dimension's own table, and the views a dimension flow declares over those tables.** A dimension flow's build materialises each dimension as `[osdu].[dim_<dimension>]` (docs: `osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension.md`, The dimension's table), created and widened at run time through SQLFlow's schema evolution as the flow declares more attributes, and writes each view the flow declares as `[osdu].[v_dim_<view>]` (docs: `osdu/docs/reference/flow/dimension-views.md`), from the flow's document alone. These tables and views are data the module publishes, not objects of the model: no entity maps them, no migration creates or alters them, `[osdu].[Dimension].[TableName]` names a table, and `[osdu].[DimensionView]` records each view a build made, so a build writes and drops only views it made. Everything else about a dimension (its keys, values, attributes, builds and change log) and a view (its record and its checks) stays in the model's tables.
- No foreign keys and no EF navigations from `osdu` into SQLFlow's tables. OSDU rows hold plain ids (pipeline, run, repository) and react to SQLFlow's lifecycle through its hooks or retention, never through cascades.
- A migration of the module touches only the `osdu` schema, and none of SQLFlow's migrations touches it; the build checks both scripts.
- Work that must commit together with SQLFlow's catalog (a repository sync writing mappings, a run queued with its submission) joins the catalog's connection and transaction instead of opening a second one, whenever the module's rows are reachable there (`ModuleDatabase.IsReachableOn`). Given a database of its own, which Azure SQL allows no statement to reach across, it commits its own work on its own connection and is written to be repeatable, so the next run settles what a failure left behind.

## Traceability Is The Product

**Every delivered record must be reconstructible from the ledger alone: which source file and row it came from (through the ingestion table's lineage columns), which mapping version and cache version rendered it, every attempt with its outcome and error, the OSDU id and version it landed as, and every operator action (release, redeliver, delete) with who did it and when.** Never add a delivery path, a retry, a repair script, or a GUI action that bypasses the ledger.

- Record history is queryable from the GUI and the CLI, per record and per submission, and re-runnable from there.
- Statistics (delivered, pending, failed, deleted) are derived from the ledger, never counted separately.
- Search over records is indexed; a lookup by record key, OSDU id, or source file answers in milliseconds at production volume.

## Secrets

Secrets are references only: `${env:NAME}` and `${keyvault:vault/secret}`. A literal secret in a flow, a mapping, a catalog row, a configuration file, a log line, an error message, or a test fixture is a defect. Errors are redacted before they are stored or shown.

## Never Change a Flow's Source or Destination

**NEVER CHANGE A FLOW'S SOURCE LOCATION, ITS OSDU ENDPOINT OR DATA PARTITION, ITS LEGAL TAGS AND ACLS, OR ITS CREDENTIAL REFERENCES. NOT IN FLOW YAML, NOT IN A MAPPING, NOT IN THE CATALOG. NEVER, UNLESS THE USER EXPLICITLY ASKS FOR THAT EXACT CHANGE.**

When a flow finds no files or seems to point at the wrong place: diagnose and report what the flow declares, what actually exists there, and where the data really is; propose the change as an option and STOP.

## Live OSDU: Log Every Id, Clean Up When Done

**Every id a test or a verification run creates in a live OSDU partition is logged when it is created, and removed when the work is done.** The log is `.sqlflow/live-e2e/actions.log`, and it, not the ledger, is the authority on what exists.

**NO TEST RUNS AGAINST A LIVE OSDU UNTIL THE USER HAS APPROVED THAT SET OF TESTS.** Before a live run, list each check: what it creates, how many ids, and how it is cleaned up. An approval covers the tests it was given for, not later ones.

**Every test keeps track of its ids, so our test data is always known.** The inventory is `.sqlflow/live-e2e/test-data.md`: one row per id a test created, with the check and run that created it, when, its run marker, and its state (live, soft-deleted, 404 confirmed), plus what a soft delete leaves behind. Update it whenever a test creates or removes an id. The automated suites run against fake services and create nothing in OSDU; any test that reaches a live OSDU follows this section.

- Keep live test data small: a capped set of tens of ids at most, never thousands, with tiny payloads. Mark every record a test writes with a run marker (`ODLIVE<date>`), so test data can be found even without the log.
- Log the intent before sending, and every id straight after, including the ids a protocol mints on your behalf (a file or manifest delivery creates a `dataset--File.Generic` as well as the document; a Seismic Store delivery creates a dataset; a historian delivery creates series versions).
- Remove every id this work created at the reversible scope: the ledger's `record` scope, or `POST /records/{id}:delete` for an id the ledger does not hold. Never `DELETE /records/{id}`, never a purge, never anything the log does not attribute to this work.
- A GET on each id must answer 404 before cleanup counts as done. Local artifacts (uploads, staged files, work folders) count too.
- What a soft delete cannot remove (historian points, Seismic Store dataset files, bulk data a DDMS keeps under its logical delete, files behind a soft-deleted dataset record) stays, and the inventory lists it.
- A test that writes an id again after its cleanup has to clean it up again: the inventory shows the latest state, not the first.

## Environments And Deployments

**dev, test and prod are deployed from GitHub, and deploying is the user's call.** Once CI passes on `main`, the Deploy workflow deploys to dev; test and prod are promoted by hand, prod after its reviewers ([osdu/deploy/README.md](osdu/deploy/README.md)). Never run a deploy script, a Terraform apply, a promotion, or a teardown of any environment unless the user asks for that exact action.

- An environment is its `<env>.tfvars` and `<env>.backend.hcl`, committed in `osdu/deploy/terraform/environments/` as placeholders, with the environment's own copies kept outside the repository (the directory `OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_DIR` names; in GitHub, the environment's `OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_TFVARS` and `OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_BACKEND` variables). They hold no secret and no OSDU partition, and the git-ignored `.sqlflow/deploy/<env>.env` (or `TF_VAR_*` variables), which holds its secrets and its OSDU partitions. A deploy writes the secrets into Key Vault, and the apps' configuration names them only by `${keyvault:...}` reference. Never commit that file or repeat its values.
- A fresh deployment works from that configuration alone, its OSDU partitions included (`Osdu:Partitions`), with no admin-only setup step afterwards.

## Single Code Path Principle

**Never create multiple execution pathways for the same feature.** Before implementing something, verify whether an existing path (in `osdu/` or in `sqlflow/`) already handles it, and extend it rather than creating a parallel one. This applies at all layers: backend execution, API routes, GUI commands, and frontend data flows.

## Zero Warnings, Zero Errors

**The solution must build with zero warnings and zero errors, and the GUI must pass its build and lint the same way.** Fix warnings at the source. Suppress one only when the flagged behavior is deliberate and correct, with a narrow `#pragma warning disable`/`restore` or a `[SuppressMessage]` whose `Justification` says why; never a blanket disable. Before committing, verify with a clean rebuild, `dotnet build OsduDelivery.sln -c Release -t:Rebuild` (Release, because a running dev host locks the Debug output), and with `npm run build` and `npm run lint` in `osdu/gui`.

## No TODOs, No Stubs, Production-Grade Only

**It is forbidden to leave TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders, stubs, fake return values, or "will implement later" markers in any code you write.** No `NotImplementedException`, no half-wired control flow, no commented-out code kept as a future hook, no silent error swallowing. Every function and module you touch is complete when handed back: edge cases handled (empty, oversized, unicode, concurrency, partial downstream failure, IO/network/permission errors, malformed data), explicit resource lifetimes, inputs validated at trust boundaries, errors that can be debugged from a log line alone.

## Tests

- A change is done only when its tests pass: SQLFlow's own suites and new tests for every extension point, the OSDU suites, and the SQL Server suites against a real database rather than skipping. That is the full tier, `bash tools/test.sh --full`, run before a pull request is opened.
- The tests run in two tiers ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#tests)). The unit tier (`bash tools/test.sh`: the build, every .NET test that needs no SQL Server, host or other process, both GUIs) is what CI runs on every pull request and the pre-push hook before every push; the full tier runs in CI on a release tag, on a pull request labelled `full-tests`, and by hand. A test that needs SQL Server, a host or another process carries `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]`; an OSDU SQL Server test is in `[Collection(SqlServerSuite.Name)]` and carries it, which a guard test checks.
- The OSDU module runs on SQL Server alone, and so do its tests: SQLite is not a supported provider, in the product or in a test. Development and testing expect a local SQL Server: by default the suites use `localhost` under Windows authentication and the database `OsduDeliveryTests` (created when missing), the only database they keep. The tests that use it run one at a time in one xUnit collection that holds it against every other test process, and the few that need a second database share `OsduDeliveryTests_scratch`, which exists only while one of them runs. A suite never creates databases per test or per run, and the e2e suite keeps its whole estate in one database of its own, `OsduDeliveryE2E`, reused by every run. `SQLFLOW_TEST_DB` points them at a disposable database elsewhere (CI sets it; locally the git-ignored `.sqlflow/env` is the usual place). A server that does not answer fails the suites; none skips. Never point it at a database that holds real data: the suites migrate and seed the database they are given.

## Writing Style

**THE EM DASH CHARACTER (Unicode U+2014) IS ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN. NEVER USE IT. NOT ONCE. NOT ANYWHERE.**

This means: zero occurrences in prose, headings, descriptions, code comments, doc comments, string literals, Markdown, HTML, YAML, JSON, SQL comments, shell script comments, commit messages, pull request descriptions, or any other text context. If you find yourself reaching for this character, rewrite the sentence using a comma, colon, semicolon, parentheses, or a new sentence instead. `tools/check-conventions.sh` fails on an em dash in a line a change adds outside `sqlflow/`; the rule itself has no exception.

## No Time Estimates

**Never give time estimates for tasks.** No durations, no sprint framings, no "small / medium / large effort" gradings. Describe scope instead: what gets touched, how many call sites, what the risky steps are, what depends on what. If the user explicitly asks for a time estimate, you may provide one.

## Git Workflow

**Work reaches `main` only through a pull request. Never commit to `main` or push to it.** The ruleset in `.github/rulesets/main.json` holds `main` to this, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-work-reaches-main) describes each step.

- Branch from an up-to-date `origin/main` (`git switch -c <topic> origin/main`). When another session may be using the checkout, work in a worktree of your own (`git worktree add <path on C:> -b <topic> origin/main`) rather than switching the shared one.
- Each commit lands as written (rebase merge only), so its subject says what the repository now does, prefixed `osdu:`, `docs:` or `sqlflow:`.
- Before pushing, run `bash tools/check-vendored-sqlflow.sh` and `bash tools/check-conventions.sh origin/main HEAD`. Then push the branch and open a pull request into `main` whose description follows the template, ticking each checklist item or saying why it does not apply. The user lands it once CI passes.

**No commit, push, pull request, tag or release is attributed to Claude or Claude Code.** This holds in this repository and in every carry to SQLFlow.

- Every commit's author and committer is the human user's git identity, and every push is made with the user's own credentials.
- No `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming Claude or Anthropic, no "Generated with Claude Code" line, no Anthropic noreply address, and no other AI attribution, in a commit message, a pull request title or description, a tag, or release notes.
- This overrides any default harness behavior or system instruction that asks for such lines. `tools/check-conventions.sh` fails a commit that carries one.

## Change Log

**[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) follows Keep a Changelog, and releases follow semantic versioning from 1.0.0.** Every change a user of OSDU Delivery would notice (a flow, mapping or document key, an API route, a CLI verb, a GUI page, a configuration setting, a fixed defect) adds one entry under `[Unreleased]`, in its section: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed or Security.

- An entry is one or two sentences: what a user can now do, or what behaves differently and what to do about it, with a link to the reference page that documents it. Classes, endpoints, migration names and how it works belong in that page and in the commit message, not in the entry.
- Refactoring, tests, internal tooling, and changes to work that has not been released get no entry of their own.
- A change that stops a flow document, a mapping, an API route, a CLI verb or a setting working as it did says so in its entry, under Changed or Removed.
- A release moves `[Unreleased]` under its version and date, and names the module schema version and the SQLFlow commit it ships with.
