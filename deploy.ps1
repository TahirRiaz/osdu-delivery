.SYNOPSIS
    OSDU Delivery container deploy: detect which images actually changed since the
    tag each app is serving, build those in ACR (fast + parallel, once per commit),
    point the container apps at the new tag, verify the new revision is actually
    serving, and roll back automatically if it is not. With -Infrastructure, plan
    and apply an environment's Terraform instead.

.DESCRIPTION
    The image tag is the current commit's short SHA (what the apps actually run).
    Keep this script at the repo root. Do NOT run it while a manual deploy is in
    flight: it wipes .deploy-ctx on start.

    ENVIRONMENTS: deploy-dev.ps1, deploy-test.ps1 and deploy-prod.ps1 run this script
    with -Environment dev, test or prod, which reads that environment from
    osdu/deploy/terraform/environments/<env>.tfvars: its subscription_id,
    resource_group_name and acr_name, and the app names when it overrides them. The
    same file is the environment's Terraform variables, so the estate Terraform
    creates and the estate this script deploys to are one definition. The GitHub
    Deploy workflow runs the same script. When OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_DIR names a directory,
    the environment's <env>.tfvars and <env>.backend.hcl are read from there instead,
    so an environment's values can stay out of the repository, whose copies then keep
    their placeholders (the Deploy workflow writes them there from its GitHub
    environment's OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_TFVARS and OSDU_ENVIRONMENT_BACKEND variables).

    ESTATE without an environment: the resource group, registry, subscription and app
    naming schemes are parameters with no defaults for the estate itself (-ResourceGroup,
    -Registry, -Subscription, or OSDU_DEPLOY_RG / OSDU_DEPLOY_ACR / OSDU_DEPLOY_SUBSCRIPTION).
    They name an EXISTING estate: the script targets apps by name and creates nothing.

    Built once per commit: an image whose tag (the commit) the registry already holds is
    reused, not built again, so promoting a commit to an environment sharing the registry
    costs no build.

    INFRASTRUCTURE (-Infrastructure, with -Environment): terraform init against the
    environment's state (its <env>.backend.hcl), plan with its variables
    (its <env>.tfvars, image_tag = this commit), show the plan and apply it once
    the environment's name is typed back (-AutoApprove skips the question: the GitHub
    workflow, where the environment's approval is the gate). No secret reaches Terraform:
    the deployment generates its own into the estate's vault, and a person puts the rest
    there (each partition's client secret, a repository's token). What an environment
    keeps out of the repository (its OSDU partitions, TF_VAR_osdu_partitions) comes from
    the process environment or from the git-ignored .sqlflow/deploy/<env>.env (NAME=value
    lines), never from a committed file. The images of apps the plan is about to create
    are built first; an app that exists keeps the image it serves (the Terraform ignores
    image changes: this script rolls them forward). Once applied, the script waits for the
    control plane's start-up pass and shows each of its steps, each repository's sync and
    whether the chat assistant is on, signed in as the initial admin with the password the
    deployment generated: the estate is ready to use when every step is done.

    Change detection (the single interface: run it bare and it deploys what is required):
      * Each app declares the paths its image is built from (its Dockerfile plus the
        source trees that Dockerfile reads). The tag an app currently serves IS a
        commit SHA, so `git diff <servingTag> HEAD -- <paths>` decides whether the
        image needs a rebuild. Unchanged apps are skipped, with the reason printed.
      * Bare invocation considers control-plane, worker, and gui, and mcp when the estate
        has an MCP server app (it is optional: an estate without one skips it). Naming apps
        explicitly deploys them unconditionally (no change filter): an explicit ask is an
        order, and it is also the escape hatch when detection must be bypassed.
      * An app with no serving image, a foreign image, or a tag that is not a commit
        in this clone counts as changed: when the baseline cannot be trusted, deploy.

    Fast path (why this is not just `az acr build .`):
      * Context is a `git archive` of TRACKED files only, extracted to .deploy-ctx.
        `az acr build .` uploads the whole working tree and does NOT honor
        .dockerignore on the client side, so it ships gigabytes of bin/obj/
        node_modules every build. The archive is tens of MB.
      * Every image builds from the SAME repository-root context: the .NET hosts in
        osdu/hosts reference both osdu/src and sqlflow/src, the GUI compiles osdu/gui
        together with the vendored sqlflow/gui sources it imports, and the MCP server
        compiles the vendored sqlflow/tools/sqlflow-mcp with both trees' documentation.
      * Each build runs FROM INSIDE the context directory with `--file <path> .`,
        because az resolves --file against the current working directory, not the
        context path.
      * Builds run in parallel, and each is verified by its ACR run id polled to a
        terminal state. The az CLI can crash on a glyph AFTER the server build
        succeeds (cp1252 cannot encode its check mark), so the local exit code is not
        trusted; the run id (printed before any crash) is.

    SAFETY (why this script refuses to guess):
      * An estate can hold the same app under more than one naming scheme (a renamed
        estate beside the one it replaced). `az containerapp update -n <name>` targets by
        name alone, so a stale name silently deploys to the DEAD environment and still
        reports success. This script resolves each app across every -AppPrefix given and
        REFUSES to continue when the choice is ambiguous: pass -Target with the prefix
        you mean.
      * Every deploy prints the resolved app, its environment, and the image it is
        replacing, before anything is changed. Use -WhatIf to see that plan and stop.
      * A deploy is not "done" when the API accepts it. Each app is verified to be
        serving the new tag on a healthy revision; if it is not, the app is rolled back
        to the exact image it was running and the script exits non-zero.
      * Building from a dirty tree is an error, not a warning: the image would not
        contain your changes. Pass -Force if that is genuinely what you want.

    NOT handled here: creating the container apps (they must already exist, with their
    identity/secrets/env wired), and the flow YAML in the estate's flow repositories.

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-dev.ps1
    Deploy to dev whichever of control-plane, worker, gui (and mcp, when the estate has it)
    changed since the tag each serves. deploy-test.ps1 and deploy-prod.ps1 do the same for
    test and prod; each is this script with -Environment.

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-test.ps1 all
    Same change detection, across every app: control-plane, worker, gui, mcp.

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-prod.ps1 control-plane worker
    Force exactly those apps, changed or not. Known: control-plane worker gui mcp

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-prod.ps1 -WhatIf
    Resolve the targets and print the plan without building or deploying.

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy-dev.ps1 -Infrastructure
    Plan dev's Terraform and apply it after the environment's name is typed back.
    With -WhatIf it stops after the plan.

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup my-rg -Registry myacr -Subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    Name an estate no environment file describes, instead of through OSDU_DEPLOY_RG,
    OSDU_DEPLOY_ACR and OSDU_DEPLOY_SUBSCRIPTION.

.EXAMPLE
    .\deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroup my-rg -Registry myacr -Subscription <id> -AppPrefix osdu-delivery-,osdu- -Target osdu-delivery-
    Search both naming schemes, and deploy to the osdu-delivery- one where an app exists under both.
