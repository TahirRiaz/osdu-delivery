 * A single-line value that clips with an ellipsis at a fixed pixel cap and reveals the full text in a hover
 * panel. The full string stays in the DOM (only visually clipped), so it remains selectable and copyable. This
 * is the one canonical way to render potentially long free-text values (paths, URLs, object keys, SQL, errors)
 * in a table cell or detail row, so a long value can never blow out the surrounding layout.
 *
 * The panel appears only when it has something to add: a value actually clipped by the cap, a multi-line value
 * whose line breaks the single line hides, or a value given a `title` to identify it. A short value that is
 * already fully visible gets no hover at all, so dragging the pointer across a table does not trail a string of
 * panels repeating text that is right there on screen.
