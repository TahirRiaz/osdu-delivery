// The e2e suite spins up EVERYTHING itself:
//  1. the OSDU Delivery control plane host (dotnet), pointed at the suite's one database, OsduDeliveryE2E; bootstrap
//     provisioning applies SQLFlow's catalog migrations and the OSDU module's beside them, seeds roles, and creates the
//     e2e admin the tests sign in with. The chain's source and ingestion tables are in the same database, in schemas
//     of their own;
//  2. the GUI dev server, pointed at that control plane via VITE_API_BASE_URL (which wins in dev mode);
//  3. a stand-in for the OSDU platform the sample flows deliver to (e2e/osdu-standin.mjs), which answers the wellbore
//     searches a WellLog or a trajectory makes when it renders, and nothing else, so no run reaches a real OSDU.
// Requirements on the machine: a SQL Server the suite may create a database on, sqlcmd, and the .NET SDK, same as the
// DB-backed xUnit suites. The default connection uses integrated security on a local server; SQLFLOW_E2E_CATALOG_DB
// names any other, a SQL login included (CI runs the suite that way).
//
// Both ports are overridable so the suite can run next to a developer's own environment. This matters most
// for the GUI port: a long-running `npm run dev` server on the default 5173 points at the DEV control plane
// (public/config.json), and reuseExistingServer would silently reuse it, so every API call in the suite
// would land on the wrong backend and fail with rejected e2e tokens.
