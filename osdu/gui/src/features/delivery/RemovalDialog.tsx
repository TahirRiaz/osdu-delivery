 * removed. In the ledger, deleting the records' history is a step of its own, offered only with a choice that leaves them
 * out of OSDU. Every row carries the same mark of whether it can be undone, and anything permanent asks for the partition
 * to be typed back. What the ledger does and the call each choice makes are on hover, beside it; the endpoint and route
 * are beside the partition, which stays in sight.
 *
 * It removes an inventory's ids the same way (`inventory`): the ids of one finding, picked or every one, through the
 * inventory flow's own source, removed or (where the flow allows it) purged; there is no ledger part, since no ledger holds
 * them live, what is checked again of each id before it goes is said under the choices, and the partition is typed back
