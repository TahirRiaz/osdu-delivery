/**
 * Keeps a scrolling element as tall as the window leaves below where it starts, less `below` (what stays under it: a
 * footer, the page's padding, the workbench's status bar), and never shorter than `min`, so its rows scroll inside it and
 * the page itself does not scroll for them. The height is set on the element, so rows never render at a height the next
 * frame changes.
 *
 * `target` picks the element to size inside the one `ref` holds (a table's own scrolling container); a module-level
 * function keeps the fit from being set up again on every render.
 *
 * `property` is what is set: the most the element may grow to (`maxHeight`, the default, for a list as tall as its rows up
 * to the room there is), or its height (`height`, for a frame that fills the room whatever it holds, such as panes side by
 * side). A frame given its height is watched itself as well, so one shown again after it was hidden is fitted to where it
 * now starts.
