# 0007: Manifest datasets take ids derived from their record's id

Status: proposed. Design reference: sections 8.1 and 16.3.

## Context

The ingestion workflow registers the datasets a manifest carries. Left to it, the ids are minted by the
platform and never come back through the workflow API, so a redelivery could neither reference nor replace
the datasets of the previous delivery, and the ledger could not name what a record owns.

## Decision

- The `manifest` protocol gives every dataset entry an id derived from the record id and the dataset
  kind: `{partition}:{datasetType}:{recordSuffix}-{chunkIndex}`.
- The record's dataset list is written with those ids before the workflow runs, and the ids are recorded on
  the record's target state, so purge can delete them and a redelivery overwrites them.
- The `file` protocol, which registers datasets itself through the file service, lets the service assign
  the id and records what came back; the ids of every delivery stay on the attempts.

## Consequences

- A record's datasets are reconstructible from the ledger alone for both protocols.
- Client-supplied dataset ids depend on the partition accepting them, as decision 0002 already assumes for
  the records themselves.
