# The explorer

The explorer is a browser of what an OSDU partition holds, read live from OSDU's own search, storage and schema
services. It answers "what is in OSDU?", where the Records page answers "what did the delivery system do?". Nothing it
shows comes from the ledger, a mapping, the cache or the catalog: the types, the records, their versions, their links
and the records that mention them are what OSDU answers at that moment. Delivery metadata only ever helps write a query:
a search by a column of a source system ([search terms](search-terms.md)) is carried to what the records hold the way a
delivery carries it, then asked of OSDU like any other. The explorer never reads a DDMS.

It is the **Explorer** entry under **In OSDU** in the workbench's OSDU menu (`/delivery/explorer`), and it reads the
partition picked in the title bar.

## How it reaches OSDU

The explorer borrows one thing from OSDU Delivery: a way in. Every read runs in the control plane as the request's
answer (the operation `delivery-explore`), nothing queued and nothing polled, through the OSDU connection of a delivery
flow that reaches the partition: the flow's endpoint, credentials and `data-partition-id`, resolved with the partition's
central configuration as a run resolves them. The reader never picks the flow. Of the active delivery flows (every
interface of a source), the control plane takes one that reaches the partition:

- a flow that names its partitions must serve this one;
- a flow that names none must either write this partition literally in its `data-partition-id` header (a `${...}`
  reference does not count) or have a ledger kept in it;
- its route must use the platform's own services: `storage` first (its endpoint is the platform root by definition),
  then `manifest`, `file`, `dataset`, `workflow`, `fileAndDdms`, `manifestAndDdms` and `ddms`; a `dspdm` or `etp` flow
  never lends its connection;
- ties go to the first flow by name, so a partition is always read the same way.

When one is found, a green badge with the partition's name stands beside the page's title; its tooltip, **Read live from
OSDU**, names the flow (`flow/interface` for a source's interface) and its endpoint as the flow writes it. When none is,
every read answers 409 with the reason, for example `No delivery flow reaches partition 'test', so the explorer has no
connection to it. A flow that delivers there through the platform's own services (any route but dspdm and etp) lends the
explorer its connection.`

Whatever route the flow delivers by, the explorer reads:

| Service | Calls | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search | `POST /api/search/v2/query` | types and their counts, records, groups of values, mentions |
| Storage | `GET /api/storage/v2/records/{id}`, `GET /api/storage/v2/records/versions/{id}`, `GET /api/storage/v2/records/{id}/{version}` | a record, its version list, an older version |
| Storage | `POST /api/storage/v2/query/records` | the records a record refers to, during a validation |
| Schema | `GET /api/schema-service/v1/schema`, `GET /api/schema-service/v1/schema/{id}` | a kind's properties, validation, Referenced by |

A record is read the way a record page's OSDU tab reads it back, so both pages show a record the same way. A `storage`
flow's `protocolOptions.verifyPath`, and any flow's `protocolOptions.verifyBatchPath`, replace the default storage paths.

The control plane keeps the connection between reads (at most 64 targets, each retired after 10 minutes unused or 30
minutes in all, and at once on the 401 a rotated secret draws), so a token is fetched once rather than for every read.
A person is waiting on these reads, so they retry as a person would rather than as a run: at most two attempts, a
backoff of at most two seconds, no wait on a `Retry-After`, and at most 60 seconds (or the flow's own shorter timeout)
for an answer.

**Who may use it.** The page's route asks for the `operate` scope, and its reads sit in the control plane's operate
group, because they use a flow's credentials. SQLFlow resolves `operate` to any signed-in user
([authentication and identity](authentication-and-identity.md)), so in practice anyone signed in can use the explorer.
The MCP server offers none of its routes: it answers from metadata alone, and the explorer reads OSDU's data.

## The welcome

The page opens on a welcome that reads nothing from OSDU, so it shows at once however large the partition:

- **Recently opened**: the records opened lately in this browser (the last 20), as a grid; **Clear** forgets them.
- **Types**: **Browse every type**, and the types browsed lately (the last 12).
- **Search syntax**: what the search field takes, with an example of each.

Both lists are kept in the browser only. `/` anywhere on the page outside a field puts the cursor in the search field.
OSDU is read only once the reader asks: **Browse every type** reads the types and waits for one to be picked, a type
picked reads its records, a search reads what it finds, and a record opened reads that record and nothing behind it.

## Types and records

Once asked, the page shows the partition's kinds beside the records of the place picked.

- **The type list.** One search aggregation over `kind` across every kind (`*:*:*:*`) counts the records of each, and the
  list groups them as OSDU names them: the group (`master-data`, `reference-data`, `work-product-component`, `dataset`),
  the type, and under a type kept in several kinds (versions, authorities) each kind. Groups start folded, but for the
  one holding the place picked, and while a search is in view the groups it finds something in open (unless one holds
  more than 24 types). **Filter types** finds a type among hundreds; **All types** lists every record of the partition.
  Picking a group, a type or a kind narrows the records to it (`*:*:master-data--*:*`, `*:*:master-data--Wellbore:*`, or
  the kind). The counts follow the search and the conditions, so the list also says where else a search finds something.
- **The records grid.** One row per record: its name (the first of `data.FacilityName`, `data.Name`,
  `data.ProjectName`, `data.Code` or the file name in `data.DatasetProperties.FileSourceInfo.Name`, else the unique part
  of its id), its type when every type is in view, its id (cut from the start, so the end that tells ids apart stays
  visible, with a copy on hover), when it last changed, and a column for each property a condition asks, so the grid
  shows why each record is there. Rows load a hundred at a time as the grid scrolls; only the rows in view are drawn.
  The arrow keys, Page Up and Down, Home and End move through them, and Enter opens one.
- **The place line** over the grid says where the records are (each step a way back), how many there are (the index's
  exact count), and what the search service made the explorer do. At its end: the order, **Filter**, **Group by**, then
  as icons the query sent, **Referenced by**, **Validate** and **Read again from OSDU**.
- **Order**: Index order (Best match once text is typed), Last modified or Last created, newest first. An order the
  service refuses is dropped with a note.
- **Group by**: any property of the records in view, grouped by its distinct values with their counts; a value picked
  narrows the records to it, as the condition **is**. A property inside a nested list is grouped through it.

The search service pages through the first 10,000 records a query matches; past them the grid's foot says to narrow the
search. Every page is one query of the index, so a partition of millions reads as fast as one of hundreds. What was read
is kept for a minute and reused (the types of a whole partition and a kind's properties for ten minutes); **Read again
from OSDU** reads at once.

## Searching

One search field, in the page's header, searches the place in view and keeps it (`Search Wellbore by id, name or any
text`, or `Search every type by id, name or any text`). Clearing it (its cross, Escape, or Enter on the empty field)
lists every record of the place again. A hint at the field's end says what Enter will do (`open`, `search`, `query`,
`clear`). What is typed is read once into a query:

| Typed | Read as | Query sent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nothing | every record of the place | none |
| a whole id, `dev:master-data--Wellbore:abc123` (a version or a trailing colon is dropped) | opens the record | |
| the start of an id, `dev:master-data--Wellbore:WB-` or `master-data--Wellbore:WB-` (completed with the partition) | the ids starting with it | `id:dev\:master\-data\-\-Wellbore\:WB\-*` |
| words, `Wellbore A 1` | a phrase anywhere in a record | `"Wellbore A 1"` |
| one word of three or more characters with one type in view | the phrase, or the record of that type whose id is or starts with it | `"WB-0042" OR id:"dev:master-data--Wellbore:WB-0042" OR id:...*` |
| a machine-minted unique part (a GUID, a hash) in every type | the phrase, or any id of the partition ending with it | `"..." OR id:dev\:*\:...*` |
| a Lucene query, with the braces button on | as written | the text |

A value is always sent as a quoted phrase, since the service ORs bare words together. A query the service refuses (400)
is not a failure: the explorer drops the order, then the clause the reading added beyond its core (the id clauses), each
with a note, and a query still refused is the page's answer, with the service's words (**The search service refused this
search**). Anything else that keeps an answer from coming fails the read, since an empty page would say OSDU holds
nothing. A search is at most 2,000 characters, and a character that cannot be printed is refused.

**The query** icon in the place line shows what the list is read by, exactly as sent: the `kind` and the Lucene `query`
(none where the list is every record of the kind). It is copied as written or as a request, or taken into the search
field with **Edit**, to be changed there.

## Conditions and properties

What is typed in the field is searched in every property. It can be searched in one property or source column instead,
picked at the field's start (**In** a property; **Every property** goes back), and any property can be asked a condition
of its own with **Filter**. Every condition holds together with the text, and each is a chip over the grid that reads as
a sentence (`FacilityName starts with Wellbore A`); a click opens it again, its cross drops it, **Clear all** drops every one. A
page takes at most 12 conditions. The editor lists the values the records in view hold at the property, the commonest
first with their counts; picked under **contains** or **starts with**, a listed value becomes **is**.

Every condition is written the way the platform indexes the property:

| Condition | For | Query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **contains** | text | the words as a phrase anywhere, any case: `data.FacilityName:"Wellbore A"` |
| **is**, **is not** | any | the whole value: `data.Source.keyword:"welldb"`, `NOT (...)` |
| **is one of**, **is none of** | any but a boolean | up to 50 whole values: `(data.Source.keyword:("welldb" OR "WELLDB"))` |
| **starts with** | text, a keyword | the start of the whole value, case included: `data.FacilityName.keyword:Wellbore\ A\-*` |
| **is in a range** | a number, a date | from a value (included) up to another (not included), either end open: `data.TopMeasuredDepth:["1000" TO "2000"}` |
| **has a value**, **has no value** | any | `_exists_:data.FacilityName`, `NOT (...)` |

A property inside a nested list (`data.GeoContexts.FieldID`) is asked in the service's nested form,
`nested(data.GeoContexts, (FieldID.keyword:"..."))`; **starts with** and the two value tests are not offered there. The
search service refuses a query whose every clause excludes, so conditions that only exclude, with no text beside them,
start from every record: `_exists_:id AND NOT (...)`. A value the index cannot compare (longer than the 256 characters a
keyword keeps whole, a word where a number is indexed) is refused before anything is read, with why.

For a type or a kind, the editor lists that type's [search terms](search-terms.md) first, as **Source columns**: a
value typed for one is the source's own, carried through the mapping before OSDU is asked.

**The properties of a place**, offered by Filter, Group by and the field, are read in one ask and grouped:

- **Content**: every value the kind's schema declares that a query can reach, read from the partition's Schema service,
  each asked as the schema has the platform index it, with the schema's title and description on hover. For a type, the
  schema read is that of its kind holding the most records.
- **Not in the schema**: values the first 20 records of the place hold that the schema does not declare, such as
  properties an index augmentation copies onto a record, or properties of another version of the kind.
- **Record**: the properties every record holds: `kind`, `id`, `createUser`, `createTime`, `modifyUser`, `modifyTime`,
  `acl.viewers`, `acl.owners`, `legal.legaltags`, `legal.otherRelevantDataCountries`.

Across every type, only the record's own properties and the name properties are offered. A schema that cannot be read is
a note at the foot of the list.

## A record

A record opens in the record inspector (the one the record page's OSDU tab uses), filling the page, with **Back to the
records** returning to the list as it was left. Its outline:

- **Record**: **Full document** (the record as OSDU returned it), **System fields** (Id, Kind, Version, Created, Last
  modified, when and through which flow it was read, the correlation id) and **Access & legal** (Viewers, Owners, Legal
  tags, Countries, Legal status).
- **Content**: the record's own blocks (`data`, `meta`, `tags`, `ancestry`), shown as **Fields** (rows of field and
  value, a list of objects as a table) or **JSON**. A value that names another OSDU record is a link that opens it in the
  inspector. **Find in record** counts and steps through matches.
- **References**: **Linked records**, every record the document names, by type, each with the paths that name it.
- **Checks**: **Validation** (see [Validate](#validate)) and **Mentioned by**, the records whose values name this one
  (`"<id>" AND NOT id:"<id>"` over every property), the first hundred listed by type.

**Versions.** The version picker reads the record at any version OSDU keeps. **Compare** puts any two side by side: what
was added, changed and removed, the two documents with their unchanged stretches folded, and every moved value with its
path. A version is read once and kept, since a version never changes. The record can also be downloaded as JSON.

**An id OSDU holds nothing under** answers `OSDU holds no record under this id`, and offers **Records with a near id**:
those whose ids go on from it (a paste cut short) and the same unique part under another type.

**The query of an element.** Beside every value and section of a record, a search button shows the Lucene query that
finds the records holding exactly that element, with **Copy** and **Search**: a value by its exact form (a text by its
`keyword` sub-field), its words, and whether a record holds one; an item of a nested list as one `nested(...)` clause
with all its values; a list or an object as every value it holds (up to 48). How each value is indexed is read from the
saved template of the record's kind; where no template says, the query is marked **guessed**. Nothing is read from OSDU
to write it.

Every record opened is remembered in this browser (the last 20). An [inventory](../flow/inventory.md) report opens one of
its ids in this same record view, in the workbench's bottom panel, with **Open in the explorer** to come here.

## Validate

The explorer checks what OSDU holds against what OSDU expects of it, with the same check the delivery system makes
before it sends a document ([preflight](preflight.md)), so a record the explorer calls invalid breaks the rule a
document would be held for.

**Validation**, under a record's Checks, checks the version in view against:

- **OSDU schema** (the default): what the partition's Schema service holds for the kind, with every schema it refers to
  bundled in (at most 200 for a kind). A reference that cannot be followed is named, and the values it describes are
  counted as not checked rather than passed.
- **Saved template**: a [template](templates.md) saved in OSDU Delivery, the kind's newest or a version picked.

The answer is the verdict a delivered record carries in its history: **valid**, **invalid** with the number of
problems, or **unverified** when a part could not be checked and nothing else is wrong. Under it: **Problems** (where,
the rule, what is wrong, and guidance: the value found, what the schema takes there, how to fix it, and OSDU's own
example value for the kind where the data definitions publish one), **Not checked** (and why), and **References not
found** (ids the record names that storage holds nothing under, looked up in storage alone). A record storage does not
hold, a kind with no schema, or a Schema service that refuses to answer is reported as not checked, with why. A record
read back with `ancestry`, `meta` or `tags` null or empty is read as if the block were absent, and the answer says so.

**Validate these records** (the shield in the place line) checks the records the search finds, as it stands, against the
schemas of their kinds: the first 1,000 the search returns, read from storage in batches. It answers how many records
the search matches and how many were read, how many came to each outcome, **Rules broken most often** (each rule at each
place with the records that break it and one example, at most 50 rules), and **Records** with each record's outcome and
first problem. When the search matches more than a check reads, it says so; a whole kind is checked by an
[assertion flow](../flow/assertion.md)'s `conforms` test.

A record page's OSDU tab offers the same Validation for the record it shows, read through that record's own flow and
partition.

**A mapping's assertions.** A check can also hold the records to the business rules a mapping states
([mapping assertions](../flow/mapping-assertions.md)): the request names a synced mapping by its id (`mapping`, as
`GET /api/v1/delivery/mappings` lists it), and the mapping's record-stage assertions are judged on each record, as a
delivery judges the documents it renders. A record page's check judges the assertions of the record's own flow's mapping
unless the request names another.

- **Validate** adds `assertions` to the verdict: how many judgements were made and failed, and each failure with the
  property, where it was found, the assertion, its stage and `onFail`, why it fails and the value. A record no schema
  can be had for is still judged: the answer says why it was not checked (`problem`), and its verdict is `notValidated`
  with the assertions' findings.
- **Validate these records** counts the records of the entity type the mapping renders (`asserted`), those failing one
  of its assertions (`failingAssertions`) and, most records first, each assertion they fail with one example (at most
  50); each record's line carries how many judgements failed on it.
- **What is not judged is said** among the notes: the incoming assertions, which judge the rows records were rendered
  from and so not what OSDU holds; a record of another entity type than the mapping renders (one of another version of
  the same type is judged on what it holds at the same properties, and the note says so); and a mapping that cannot be
  read (`No assertions were judged: no mapping is synced under <id>; its repository may no longer declare it.`).

Nothing is held or left out of a record OSDU already holds: every failure is reported, whatever its `onFail`. A whole
kind is held to a mapping's assertions by an [assertion flow](../flow/assertion.md#holding-records-to-a-mappings-assertions)'s
`mapping` test.

## Referenced by

**Referenced by**, in the place line when one type or one of its kinds is picked, lists the types whose schemas name
records of that type: the users of a code list before it changes, or the kinds a master record is named from.

- **What counts**: a property marked `x-osdu-relationship` naming the type, wherever it sits (in `data`, in `meta`,
  inside a list, inside an abstract schema the kind is made of, in one form of a choice). Where a schema marks no
  relationship, an id pattern naming the type counts too, marked **by pattern**.
- **The answer**: the types by group, each version the partition holds as a chip (solid where its schema names the type,
  dashed where it does not), and under it each property path. A type opens its records. **Only types with records**
  keeps the versions the partition holds records of. Properties that name any record of the type's group are listed
  apart.

The Schema service cannot be asked which schemas refer to a type, so the control plane reads the partition's schemas once
and keeps what each names: one reading per Schema service and partition (16 partitions at most), shared by every reader.
A pass lists every schema a hundred at a time, then reads each kind's schema eight at a time; an ask waits a few seconds
and then answers with where the pass stands, and the dialog asks again until it is done. A later pass reads only the
kinds added since and those in development, since a published or obsolete schema never changes. A pass runs when nothing
has been read, when the reader asks (**Read the partition's schemas again**), or when the reading is older than twelve
hours; a pass that fails keeps the last reading and runs again when asked, or after two minutes. A pass that has failed
to read 50 kinds, more than it read, stops, since the service is failing rather than one schema.

## Building a dimension

**Build a dimension**, in the header, docks the dimension builder beside the records (the workbench's side bar folds
meanwhile). The key, the value and the attributes of a [dimension](../flow/dimension.md) are picked on the values
themselves as records are browsed and their links followed: beside each value a menu offers **Make it the key**,
**Collect it**, **Read it as the value** or **Read it as an attribute**, depending on where the record sits on the trail.
The builder suggests keys from the kind's saved template (the values that name other records), fills an example row with
what one key reads, and writes the `dimensions:` item a dimension flow lists, checked by the loader a flow is read by.
**Copy the YAML** takes it. The builder saves nothing: no flow, no dimension, nothing in OSDU or the database. The draft
lives in the page's address (`dim`), so a link or a refresh brings it back; closing the builder drops it. See
[building and using a dimension](../guides/dimensions.md).

## Kept in the address

The text (`q`) and whether it is Lucene (`lq`), the place (`kind`), the conditions (`f`), the order (`sort`), the type
list alone (`view=types`), the record open (`id`, and `v` for a version) and a dimension being built (`dim`) are the
page's address, so a link, Back and a refresh land on the same view. A link naming a partition (`partition`) makes it the
title bar's.

## The API

The bodies and answers are listed on the [API page](api.md). The routes that read OSDU take `?partition=`; without it
the workbench's partition, else the registry's default, is read.

| Route | Group | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/delivery/explorer/connection` | read | How the partition is reached: `available`, `through`, `endpoint`, `route`, or `reason`. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/types` | operate | The records a search finds, counted kind by kind. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/search` | operate | One page of records: `text`, `lucene` or `mentions`, `kind`, `filters` (at most 12; a filter may name a search `term`), `sort`, `offset` and `limit` (1 to 200, inside the first 10,000), `facet`, `columns` (at most 8). |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/fields` | operate | The properties the records of a `kind` hold. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/read` | operate | One record from storage by `targetId`, at its latest or at `version`, with its version list. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/validate` | operate | One record checked against its kind's schema (`schema`: `osdu` or `saved`), and against the assertions of the synced mapping `mapping` names. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/validate-list` | operate | The records a search finds checked (`max` 1 to 1,000), with `mapping` as above. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/flows/{pipelineId}/osdu/validate` | operate | The same check of one record through a flow's own route, judging the flow's own mapping's assertions unless `mapping` names another; 409 for a `dspdm` or `etp` flow. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/referenced-by` | operate | The types whose schemas name records of a `type`; `refresh` reads the schemas again. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/element-queries` | operate | The query that finds an element of a record, from the saved templates alone. |
| `GET /api/v1/delivery/explorer/dimension/candidates?kind=` | operate | The keys a kind's saved template suggests for a dimension. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/dimension/keys` | operate | The commonest keys of a drafted dimension's path. |
| `POST /api/v1/delivery/explorer/dimension/compose` | operate | A draft written as a dimension flow's item, and checked. |

A request the read would refuse (a kind that is not one, more than 12 conditions, a page past the window, an id that is
not one) answers 400 before anything is read, with the reason, for example `The search service pages through the first
10,000 records a query matches; narrow the search to reach the others.` A partition no flow reaches answers 409. When
OSDU refuses or cannot be reached the answer is 502, and with no answer within the timeout 504, each with the reason
redacted.
