# Submissions, work batches and leases: how a delivery run plans and sends its records

A deliver run of a [delivery flow](../flow/delivery.md) does two things: it **plans** (the intake reads the ingestion
tables, renders each record and decides what to send) and it **drains** (workers claim the planned records and send them to
OSDU). One plan is a **submission**; its rendered documents are written to **work batch** files; workers claim batches and
records under **leases**, so any number of nodes can deliver one flow at once. Everything is recorded in the
[ledger](ledger.md) as it happens. This page explains each of them and what to expect when you run, re-run or stop a flow.

## The operations of a delivery flow

A run of a delivery flow performs one operation, the one it names (`sqlflow run <flow.yaml> --operation <name>`) or
`deliver`. See [Running an OSDU flow](../cli/run.md) for the options and payload.

| Operation | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `deliver` | Plan the selection into a submission, then drain it; send what submissions no run works on any more still hold (released records of settled submissions, and submissions a stopped run left open, which it then closes; see [Recovering a stopped submission](#recovering-a-stopped-submission)); undo what unfinished deliveries left. |
| `plan` | Plan and report what would be sent, with a sample of the records it would send. Stages nothing in the ledger and sends nothing. |
| `intake` | Plan into work batches without sending: a fan-out member's share, or a plan to drain later. |
| `drain` | Send the work batches already planned, of the flow or of one submission. |
| `replan` | Read every row of the scope again and deliver what renders differently. |
| `verify` | Read back delivered records from OSDU and record `match`, `drifted` or `missing`: up to 5,000 records a run, those not verified in the last 24 hours unless forced. |
| `sync` | Consolidate the ledger with the ingestion tables; renders and sends nothing ([Removal and reversal](removal-and-reversal.md#syncing-the-ledger-with-the-source)). |
| `reverse`, `undo`, `delete-ledger` | Put back what a run delivered, undo unfinished deliveries, delete the ledger ([Removal and reversal](removal-and-reversal.md)). |

Every operation of a source with interfaces runs each interface it selects in order ([Interfaces](../flow/interfaces.md)),
each under its own ledger identity, as a run of that interface alone would.

## What a run reads

The intake reads one **selection** of the ingestion tables, recorded on the submission as its kind:

| Kind | When | What it reads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `incremental` | An ordinary run of a scope that has a watermark | The rows changed after the scope's watermark, less `source.incremental.overlapSeconds`. |
| `full` | The scope has no watermark yet, a `replan`, or the mapping, template or parameters changed since the watermark was written | Every row of the scope. |
| `keys` | A run scoped to records (`recordKeys`, at most 1,000), or the records the ledger asked to be planned again | Those records' rows, by their stored key tuples. |

The **scope** is the flow's parameter set: one watermark per distinct set (`osdu.SourceWatermark`). A whole-scope plan
(`incremental` or `full`) moves the watermark to the upper bound it read when its planning finishes, with every fan-out
member successful; a `keys` plan never moves it. When no row changed in the window and no record waits to be planned again,
the run is skipped whole (the tier-0 gate) unless it is forced; the watermark still moves. See
[Change detection](change-detection.md).

Before its own read, a deliver run of a whole scope reads the records the ledger asked to be planned again (a release
without a rendered document, a redelivery, bringing records up to date, a cache rollout, a sync that found a change): 5,000
records a pass, each pass a `keys` submission of its own, as many passes as there are such records. A record a pass cannot
plan (its row gone, or outside the run's scope) keeps its request for a run that can.

## The submission

`osdu.Submission` holds one row per plan. Its id is the idempotency key: a run that names a submission (`submissionId` in
its payload) works on that submission, reading exactly the window or keys it recorded. A run the platform executes again
after an interruption (its node stopped and its lease lapsed) resumes the submission its interrupted attempt left
unsettled for the same read (a whole-scope plan resumes the whole-scope plan, a key-scoped plan only one made for
exactly the same keys) instead of registering another: it plans it again, keeps its key slices, and gets back its
fan-out members.

| Columns | What they hold |
| --- | --- |
| `FlowId`, `FlowName`, `MappingReference`, `RenderContext`, `ParametersJson` | What produced it: the ledger, the mapping, the render context and the parameter values. |
| `Kind`, `SourceConnection`, `SourceObject` | The selection, the connection reference exactly as the flow declares it (never a resolved secret), and the record table read. |
| `WindowFromUtc`, `WindowToUtc`, `SourceWindowJson` | The `UpdatedDate_DW` window and what else bounded the read: child datasets, overlap, scope values, key slices, the key digest of a `keys` plan. |
| `WorkLocation`, `BatchCount`, `Slices` | Where its work batches were written, how many, and how many key slices a fan-out cut it into. |
| `Status` | `received`, `planned`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`. |
| `RecordCount`, `Planned`, `SkippedUnchanged`, `AwaitingApproval`, `SkippedStale`, `Blocked`, `Held`, `Untracked` | What its latest planning pass found. A re-run of the submission plans it again and replaces them. |
| `Delivered`, `UnchangedAtPush` | Records its attempts delivered, or found OSDU already holding at the final check, across every pass. |
| `Held`, `Failed`, `Waiting` | When it closes: the records whose last submission it is that are held, failed or waiting now (`Held` then replaces the planning pass's count). |
| `RunId`, `ReceivedUtc`, `StartedUtc`, `CompletedUtc`, `Error` | The coordinating run and the timeline. |

**Status.** A submission is `received` while it plans. It is `planned` when the planning finished with records to send,
and `completed` at once when it planned none. A plan that finds nothing new while records an earlier pass queued are
still pending leaves the submission `planned`, not `completed`. When the drain ends it is closed from the ledger:
`running` while records of it are still pending, else `failed` when any of its records failed, else `completed`. A run
stopped part way (cancelled, or its interface stopped by `failWhen`) closes its submission as `failed` with the reason,
`stopped: ...`, while records of it are still pending, or when its planning had not finished; the flow's next run sends
them. A submission whose run ended without closing it is taken over by the flow's next deliver run
([Recovering a stopped submission](#recovering-a-stopped-submission)).

**Counts.** The closing counts are counted from the ledger each time the submission closes, never tallied while records
are sent: `Delivered` and `UnchangedAtPush` count the records the submission's own attempts settled so, `Held`, `Failed`
and `Waiting` count records now. A re-run that sends one record of three
already delivered therefore shows 1 planned and 3 delivered; what that run itself did is on the run and its activity.

**Re-running.** Running a submission again re-plans its window against the ledger as it stands now, unless it is completed
and not forced, in which case nothing is done. A `drain` with `submissionId` sends what it still holds.

## Work batches

The intake streams the rendered documents into JSON Lines files under the flow's work location (`source.work`),
`reliability.batchRecords` documents a file (500 by default). `osdu.WorkBatch` holds one row per file: its submission and
index, location, record count, status (`queued`, `running`, `done`, `failed`), the lease draining it, and how its drain ended
(delivered, held, failed, retrying, waiting). A record points at its batch and its `batch:offset:length` range; the document
itself is never stored in the database. The work location needs write access from every node that runs the flow, and its
files are part of the submission's evidence until the submission completes.

## Leases and claims

A worker takes work under a **lease**: one `osdu.Lease` row per claim, with a token (the worker's name and a fresh id), the
flow, the submission, the batch, the owner, and an expiry.

- **Claim.** A drain claims the oldest queued batch of the flow (or of one submission): the lease row and the batch's move
  to `running` commit together, so two workers never hold one batch. Records due for a retry outside a running batch are
  claimed `reliability.batchSize` at a time (50 by default, at most 500). Either way a record moves from `pending` to
  `delivering` by a compare-and-swap that also adds one to its tries, so two leases never hold one record.
- **Renew.** The worker renews its one lease row every half lease (at least a second apart). The lease lasts
  `reliability.leaseSeconds` (300 by default). A renewal that finds the lease taken over stops the worker.
- **Append.** While it sends, the worker does not write `osdu.Record`. It appends each completed step and each finished try
  to `osdu.RecordEvent`, with the try's attempt in the same transaction, at most 500 entries a write. A step is in the ledger
  before the next step starts, so a later try resumes after it.
- **Apply.** At each renewal and when the batch closes, the lease's events are applied to their records, 1,000 records a
  transaction, and deleted as they are applied. The record table therefore trails what workers have sent by at most one
  renewal; the attempts are there at once.
- **Close.** A worker that stops on its own terms hands back the records it did not reach, without charging their try, and
  the batch is `done`, `failed`, or `queued` again.
- **Recover.** Every claim first recovers the flow's leases that ran out: it takes each over by a compare-and-swap, applies
  what the stopped worker appended, hands the rest back to `pending` with the try charged and the note
  `the lease expired mid-attempt (the worker stopped) and the record was requeued`, and queues the batch again. A recovery
  holds the lease it took for five minutes, after which a recovery that itself stopped is recovered too.

A run the platform executes again resumes its submission, waits out leases a gone worker still holds, recovers them and
sends the records, resuming after the steps the stopped try had recorded. A submission whose run does not come back
(attempts ran out, a command-line run killed) is taken over by the flow's next deliver run
([Recovering a stopped submission](#recovering-a-stopped-submission)). A lease running out further ahead than the flow's
own `reliability.leaseSeconds` belongs to a live worker and is left alone with a warning.

## Many nodes

`reliability.fanOut` spreads one submission over member runs across the fleet. When the read holds at least
`reliability.fanOutMinRecords` candidates (1,000 by default), the coordinating run cuts the candidate keys into slices on the
record table's identity primary key (`source.record.primaryKey`), hands slices to up to `fanOut` intake members, plans its
own share, and finalises the submission with every member's totals. A member that fails stops the coordinating run with
`Intake member <slot> (run <id>) <status>: <error>. The submission stays planned as far as it got: re-run it to finish the intake now, or the flow's next deliver run takes it over, sends what it planned and closes it, and plans the rest in its own window.`
The drain fans out the same way, `fanOut` drain members beside the coordinating run; a drain member that fails leaves its
records to the coordinating run, which keeps draining until the submission is settled. The members appear as a run family
on the run's page.

Records of one flow written by many nodes never wait on each other for long: no statement writes more than 1,000 records,
a worker writes only its lease row and the append-only tables while it sends, staging locks only records that exist, and a
statement the database ends as a deadlock victim is run again, up to five runs in all.

## Recovering a stopped submission

A submission whose run stops before it settled (its node was lost, its process ended, it ran out of attempts, a
command-line run was killed) is not left for a drain by hand: the flow's next deliver run takes it over.

**Every run that works on a submission holds it.** The deliver run that plans it, each intake member of a fan-out, and a
drain that names a submission take a shared, session-owned application lock on the module's database,
`SqlFlow.Delivery.Submission:<id>` (`sp_getapplock`), on a connection of their own, from before the submission is
registered or reopened until they are done with it. Any number of runs hold one submission at once, as a fan-out's
coordinator and its members do. A process that stops frees its holds with its connections, whatever stopped it, which is
how a later run tells a submission somebody still works on from one whose run has ended. A hold reads and writes nothing
of the ledger, so there is no table to look at; the submission's status and leases say the rest.

**Every deliver run looks for submissions no run works on any more**, after it has sent its own records: first the
flow's submissions left `received`, `planned` or `running` that no lease which has not run out holds work of, oldest
first, 10 a page; then settled submissions holding records that are due again (released back to pending with their
rendered documents after their run was over). It takes each over only when no run holds it (an exclusive lock, asked
without waiting, then held shared), so a run still planning or sending it, a fan-out member included, is never raced; a
submission a run still holds is left to that run (`Submission <id> (<status>) is held by a run that still works on it, so
it is left to that run.`). It passes over the submission with the claims a run of it makes, so each record is sent once,
resuming after the steps a stopped try recorded, without waiting for records in backoff, and closes it. Before closing,
it checks again: a submission a whole-flow drain took work of meanwhile is left open for the flow's next run to close.
Each submission is visited once per run.

A submission its run left open is closed `failed`, its reason saying what happened:

```text
stopped: run <id> ended before its records were all sent; run <id> took it over and sent what was due, and the flow's next run sends the rest
stopped: run <id> ended before its planning finished; run <id> took it over and sent what it had planned, and the rows it had not reached are left to the flow's plans, which read them again: it moved no watermark and answered no request to plan them
```

The attempts the recovering run writes carry its own run id and the stopped submission's id, so the record's history
says which run sent it for which plan. A submission an `intake` run planned is sent and closed the same way by the flow's
next deliver run, unless a drain of it comes first.

A run that wants a submission another run is taking over in that moment waits up to 30 seconds for it, then fails:
`Submission <id> could not be held for this run within 30 seconds (sp_getapplock answered <n>): another run of the flow was taking it over, as a deliver run does with a submission no run works on any more, and that run sends what it holds. Run this one again once that run has ended.`

## One source, several flows

An ingestion table can feed several delivery flows, each rendering the rows with its own mapping. The rows are loaded once;
each flow keeps its own ledger over them.

- **A record is one flow's.** The ledger keys a record by flow and delivery key, so a row read by two flows is two records,
  each with its own state, attempts, activities, submissions and watermark, and its own counts.
- **One OSDU record, one record of the ledger.** A record claims its OSDU id the first time it queues a document
  (`ClaimedTargetId`, unique across the ledger). Work whose id another record has claimed is held and nothing is sent:
  `OSDU id <id> is already claimed by flow '<name>' (<id>), and one OSDU record belongs to one flow. Deliver this flow to another data partition, or give its mapping a dataset.system or key that yields other OSDU ids.`
  Within one flow, two keys that give one id (possible with `dataset.idFrom: key`, or after a mapping's `dataset.system` or
  key changed) are refused the same way, naming the record that holds it.
- **A record keeps the id it claimed.** A render that gives another id than the one claimed is held, naming both, and
  nothing is sent.
- **An id made from a key is claimed only when it is free.** Before a record first claims such an id, the intake asks OSDU;
  when OSDU already holds a record there that no record of the ledger claimed, or cannot say, the record is held unclaimed.
- **A flow acts only on ids it claimed.** Sends, read backs and removals reach only claimed ids, so a record that was only
  ever held never touches another flow's OSDU record.

## Ledger registration

A run registers its ledger in the partition it delivers to before it writes any row: the partition the flow is bound to, or
the one its `data-partition-id` header resolves to. A flow with neither is refused:
`Flow '<name>' names no partition, and its target.headers no 'data-partition-id', so the partition its ledger belongs to is unknown.`
