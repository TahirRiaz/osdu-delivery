# Availability, recovery, retention and backup of the delivery ledger, and the size ceilings to set

This page is for the people who run an OSDU Delivery estate: what keeps working when the control plane or a node stops,
how deliveries recover without anyone editing the ledger, what may be aged out of the `osdu` schema and how, what a backup
must hold to keep every delivered record reconstructible, and which size limits to set on purpose. The control plane, the
run queue and the node fleet are SQLFlow's; see SQLFlow's [control plane](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md)
and [`sqlflow worker`](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/cli/worker.md) for dispatch, leases on runs, requeues and drains.
This page says what OSDU Delivery adds.

## Availability

The shipped Azure deployment runs the control plane as one replica (`minReplicas` and `maxReplicas` both 1 in
`control-plane.bicep`), because only the replica that holds SQLFlow's dispatch lease hands out work and a second replica
adds no dispatch capacity. Worker nodes scale from zero on the control plane's scale target.

**While the control plane is down:**

- The API and the GUI's OSDU pages answer nothing, and the CLI's remote verbs fail. No run is queued or handed out, no
  schedule fires, no repository sync runs, no approved cache change rolls out, and the module's background passes (below)
  pause.
- A worker node already delivering keeps delivering. It reaches OSDU with the flow's own credentials and the ledger with its
  own module database connection (`SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB`), neither through the control plane, so records go on being claimed,
  sent and settled, and every attempt is written. Leave the nodes alone: a stopped node costs the runs it holds their
  progress.
- `sqlflow run` on a workstation with the module database connection still delivers: it takes the ledger's own leases,
  which any number of runs share safely.

**While a node is down:** the records it was sending stay `delivering` under its leases until they run out
(`reliability.leaseSeconds`, 300 by default). Nothing is sent twice: every step a try completed is in the ledger, and the
next try resumes after it.

## Recovery

Most of it needs nobody.

| What | How it recovers |
| --- | --- |
| The `osdu` schema | The control plane applies pending migrations of SQLFlow's catalog and then of the module database when it starts, and stops when a database is missing, behind or ahead of the build. `/health/ready` carries the refusal (its `module-databases` check). |
| Runs a stopped node held | SQLFlow requeues them once their run lease lapses, while they have execution attempts left. |
| Records a stopped worker was sending | Every claim of the flow first recovers its leases that ran out: it applies what the stopped worker had appended and hands the rest back to `pending` with the try charged ([Submissions](submissions.md#leases-and-claims)). A run that finds records of its own submission still leased waits for the lease to run out, then recovers and sends them. |
| A submission whose run stopped mid-drain | A run executed again resumes it; otherwise the flow's next deliver run takes it over once no run holds it and its leases have run out, sends what it holds and closes it ([Recovering a stopped submission](submissions.md#recovering-a-stopped-submission)); a re-run (a deliver run with `submissionId`) or a `drain` of it still works at once. A released or recovered record of a submission that settled is sent by the flow's next deliver run. |
| What unfinished deliveries left in OSDU | The sweep at the end of the next deliver run or flow-wide drain undoes it ([Removal and reversal](removal-and-reversal.md#unfinished-deliveries-and-their-undo)). |
| Removals and value checks queued as tasks | SQLFlow fails a task no worker claimed within `Dispatch:TaskQueuedExpiryMinutes` (15) with `No worker claimed the task within <n> minutes...`; a running one is requeued. A removal that runs again reports what is already gone as `already-gone` and writes its own attempts. |
| Approved cache changes | Each resumes its rollout from its own cursor ([The partition cache](partition-cache.md)). |
| The identity and issue backfills | Resume where they stopped: each reads only what is left to do. |
| Interface descriptions and search terms | The interfaces of a repository not described yet, and every repository's search terms, are written once when the control plane starts, and again by each repository sync. |
| Target probes | A probe left open by a host that stopped, scheduled or asked for, is closed as unfinished 15 minutes after it started, by the next probe of that interface or the next scheduled pass. |
| Schedules | SQLFlow fires the next occurrence; a missed one fires only when the schedule declares `catchup: true`. A deliver run plans from its watermark, so one run after an outage covers every row that changed during it. |

Then the operator's own pass, in this order:

1. `sqlflow db status --db <ref>` (exit 2 means migrations are pending) and `sqlflow health`, or `/health/ready`: a red
   readiness naming the module database means the schema and the build disagree, and the message names the migration or
   version.
2. The fleet and the dispatcher (the GUI's Nodes page, `GET /api/v1/dispatch`): a pool with a backlog and no node online.
3. Runs that failed with an interrupted message, and the submissions they left `planned` or `running`: re-run or drain them.
4. Each flow's Records tab filtered to `delivering`: a record whose lease is in the past is recovered by the flow's next
   deliver run or drain; run `drain` if none is due.
5. Removals and value checks failed with `No worker claimed the task`: ask for them again.

No step needs a repair script or a hand edit of the ledger, and none exists: every recovery goes through the ledger, which
is what keeps a delivered record reconstructible.

## Retention

The `osdu` schema is a live status store, and what may be aged out of it is bounded by one rule: every delivered record
must stay reconstructible from the ledger alone. That rules out deleting a record, its submission, the cache version it was
rendered against, or any audit row.

| Table | May be pruned |
| --- | --- |
| `osdu.Record` | Never: it is the state and the anchor of every trail. A record leaves only when an operator deletes it from the ledger after removing it from OSDU, or deletes the whole ledger, and one line of it stays in `osdu.PurgedRecord`. |
| `osdu.Attempt` | Yes, by age, and only where a later attempt of the same record exists, so every record's last outcome stays explainable. |
| `osdu.Activity` | The row never. Its captured run log (up to 200,000 characters per run) yes, by age, once the activity has finished. |
| `osdu.AssertionRun`, `osdu.AssertionResult` | Yes, by age, a run whole, and only once later results of the same tests superseded every one of its results. |
| `osdu.ActivityRecord`, `osdu.PurgedRecord`, `osdu.Artifact` | Never: they are records' histories. |
| `osdu.Submission`, `osdu.WorkBatch`, `osdu.SourceWatermark`, `osdu.Reversal`, `osdu.ReversalItem`, `osdu.Retrieval` | Not by retention: a record names its submission, an attempt its batch, a watermark is state, and a reversal is what a record's custody was put back by. Deleting a delivery flow's ledger deletes its submissions, batches, watermarks and reversals with it. |
| `osdu.Lease`, `osdu.RecordEvent` | Self-clearing: applying a lease deletes its events, and closing or recovering it deletes the lease. |
| `osdu.CacheVersion`, `osdu.CacheItem`, `osdu.CacheSet`, `osdu.CacheSetEntry`, `osdu.UpdateTag` | Never: a record's render context names the cache version it was rendered against. |
| `osdu.RecordIdentity` | Not pruned and does not grow with activity: rewritten as a set when a record is staged, deleted with the record. |

One admin call prunes everything that may go at one cut-off:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$CONTROL_PLANE/api/v1/delivery/ledger/prune" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"olderThanDays": 90}'
```

It answers `{"attemptsPruned": n, "activityLogsCleared": n, "assertionRunsPruned": n}`. The route needs the `admin` scope,
and `olderThanDays` below 1 is refused with `olderThanDays must be at least 1.` Attempts go 4,000 to a statement, oldest
first, and activity logs 1,000 to a statement, each statement its own short transaction, so a prune of years of history never
holds a long lock on the table every drain appends to. It is safe to interrupt and repeat: a second pass at the same cut-off
finds nothing left.

There is no CLI verb or GUI page for the prune, and a schedule fires a flow rather than an API call, so a regular pass is a
job of the estate's own scheduler holding an admin token, with a generous client timeout for the first pass. A 90-day
window, weekly, is the cut-off the retention decision proposes; start there and widen it only for a reason. A pass that
suddenly prunes far more than the last says a flow is retrying hard. If volume ever demands more, partition the large
tables by time in the module's model rather than delete from them.

## Backup and restore

- **Back up the `osdu` schema with SQLFlow's catalog.** By default the schema lives in the catalog's database, so one
  backup covers both. Where the module has a database of its own, the two must restore to the same instant: a run row in
  the catalog and the submission, records and attempts it wrote are one unit of work.
- **The schema carries its version.** `[osdu].[__EFMigrationsHistory]` and `[osdu].[SchemaVersion]` come with the schema.
  A restore is usable only with a build that matches: a database behind the build is migrated on start, one ahead of it
  stops the host by name, and one paired with a SQLFlow catalog older than `SchemaVersion.MinimumCatalogMigration` is
  refused. Restore the image that goes with the backup, or migrate forward. Never edit the version row.
- **The ledger needs no database option of its own.** Its reads do not depend on snapshot isolation. The ingestion
  database a delivery flow reads does: a flow reads a record and its child rows as one instant unless it declares
  `source.incremental.isolation: readCommitted`, so a rebuilt source database needs `ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON` again.

What is not in the database and has to be restored beside it:

- **The repositories.** Flows, mappings and cache flows live in git; restore the commit the catalog records, and a sync
  rebuilds the read models.
- **The secrets.** Flows carry references only (`${env:...}`, `${keyvault:...}`), so the vault and the nodes' environment
  are their own backup.
- **The work locations.** A work batch names a file under the flow's `source.work`; without those files the batches still
  queued cannot be drained. Plan those scopes again (`replan`); records already delivered are skipped as unchanged.
- **The OSDU partition the ledger describes.** A ledger restored older than its partition holds records whose OSDU copy has
  moved on; a `verify` run finds them as drift, and a flow's Records tab lists them with **Drifted only**.

## Size ceilings

**Request bodies on the way to OSDU.** Set the request body ceiling of everything between the nodes and OSDU (the service,
the ingress, an API gateway) to one deliberate number and declare it on the flows as `reliability.maxRequestBodyBytes`
(0, the default, means not declared). On the routes that send payloads, a file or request above it then holds its record
before anything is sent, rather than failing after the record was written. A 413 from the service holds the record too.
`reliability.maxResponseBytes` (64 MiB by default) bounds what a node reads back; a bigger response fails the call with
`Response from <url> exceeds the <n> MB limit. Raise reliability.maxResponseBytes.`, the URL named without its query,
and a limit below 1 MiB stated in bytes (`exceeds the 500000 byte limit`).

**What one record costs in the ledger.** Each limit is a column width; what does not fit is refused or held with a message,
never stored cut short where it would mislead:

| Value | Limit | When it is exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source key | 400 characters | Stored to that length. |
| Label | 400 characters | Stored to that length. |
| Origin file name (`FileName_DW`) | 800 characters | A file name column wider than that is refused when the source is opened, naming `source.systemColumns.fileName`. |
| OSDU id | 500 characters | A render that gives a longer id holds the record, naming the limit. |
| Last error, attempt error | 2,000 characters | Stored to that length, redacted. |
| Identity index | 24 values per record, each at most 200 characters; values under 3 characters are not stored | A record with more identifying values keeps the first. |
| Activity run log | 200,000 characters per run | Stored to that length; cleared by retention. |

A mapping that declares many `dataset.identity` columns pays more of the identity index; one that declares none still
gets its key, label, OSDU id and file.
