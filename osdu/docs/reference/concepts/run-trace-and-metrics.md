# What an OSDU run's trace says, its metrics, and watching the targets

Every run of an OSDU flow kind (delivery, retrieval, cache, assertion, dimension, inventory) leaves the same artifacts as
SQLFlow's own kinds: a `run.json` with the result and the event timeline, a `run.log`, and a `trace.sql`, which is empty
because these kinds generate no SQL of their own. On a node its lines stream to the control plane as the live trace the
GUI's trace panel and `sqlflow trigger --follow` show. Those artifacts, the log levels and the trace endpoints
(`GET /api/v1/runs/{runId}/trace`, `/trace/text`, `/trace/stream`) are SQLFlow's, documented in
[run artifacts](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/run-artifacts.md) and
[the control plane](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md).

This page covers what an OSDU run writes there, how much of it, the module's metrics, and the scheduled probe of the
delivery targets.

## The steps of a run's trace

Each line is filed under the step that said it, which is what the engine was doing rather than the class that logged it:

| Step | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| `run` | The run and who asked (`delivery flow '<name>': <operation> (parameters: ...) requested by <actor>, run <id>`); the render context (`Rendering with mapping <name@version> (template <version>) and <cache>; ids are minted in partition <partition>.`); the route (`<operation> by the <route> route`); whether the legal service accepts the mapping's legal tags; each interface of a source starting; recovered leases, fan-out members, undos; how the run ended. |
| `source` | The ingestion table opened, the window fixed and the candidate records in it. |
| `plan`, `intake` | The submission being planned, the preflight's warnings, records held with their reason, the submission's counts. |
| `deliver` | Batches claimed and finished, and the progress line: `Delivering: <settled> of <planned> planned record(s) settled after <time> (<rate> a second): <n> delivered, <n> already in OSDU, <n> to try again, <n> held, <n> failed; working on <batch>.` |
| `verify` | What a verify run compared and the drift it found. |
| `record` | The delivery events as they complete: a submission, a batch, a verify (information level), and each record's event (debug level, within the allowances below). |
| `target`, `search` | What a route's protocol, or a render's search of OSDU, says while it works. |
| `http` | Each call to OSDU at debug level (`<METHOD> <url> answered HTTP <status> in <time>`), and each retry: `<METHOD> <url>: <cause> on attempt <n> of <max>; trying again in <wait>.` |

A described record also gets its own lines on its way: `Sending <record> to <id>: <what>` and
`Delivered <record> as <id> version <n> (<phase>) in <time>`, or why it was held, failed or put back for a retry.
Warnings and errors keep their level on the event and are prefixed `warning:` and `error:` in `run.log`.

## Bounded, whatever the run's size

A delivery run moves millions of records, and every line of its trace is streamed, kept in the run's events and stored
in the catalog. So every line the engine logs while it serves a run passes one gate, whichever part logged it, and what a
run writes is bounded by these allowances:

| Allowance | What the trace carries |
| --- | --- |
| 20 described records | The first 20 records a run meets are described in full, each time it meets them again (the plan line, the send, each step and call, the outcome). Nothing is said about any other record on its own. |
| 100 lines per step | Outside the described records, each step writes at most 100 lines of its own. |
| 100 problems | The run names at most 100 warnings about records (held, failed, retried, drift). The run's own warnings (`run` step) take from that step's lines instead, so record problems never crowd them out. |
| 50 retries | At most 50 retried calls are named. |
| Paced progress | Progress lines come every 15 seconds for the first two minutes, every minute up to an hour, then every five minutes, from run-level totals rather than per batch. |

Errors are always written. When an allowance runs out the trace says so once, so it shows where its lines of that sort
stop, for example:
`The first 20 records of this run are on its trace in full; the rest show in the progress lines, and every record's history is in the ledger.`
Nothing the trace leaves out is lost: every record's attempts, with each step and status, are in the
[ledger](ledger.md) and on the record's page.

A URL on the trace never carries its query string (a signed upload URL keeps its credential there), and messages are
redacted before they are written.

## Metrics

The engine publishes its telemetry on the .NET metrics API under the meter `SqlFlow.Delivery`:

| Instrument | Unit | Tags | Measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `osdu_delivery.records` | `{record}` | `flow`, `partition`, `route`, `outcome` | Delivery tries settled: `delivered`, `unchanged`, `retry`, `held`, `failed`; and `waiting`, a record left waiting for a record it refers to (not a try). |
| `osdu_delivery.record.duration` | s | `flow`, `partition`, `route`, `outcome` | How long a try of one record took, from its claim to its outcome. |
| `osdu_delivery.http.requests` | `{request}` | `method`, `host`, `result` | Call attempts to OSDU services and their storage. `result` is `2xx` to `5xx`, or `transport`, `timeout`, `refused` (the URL guard), `cancelled` or `error`. |
| `osdu_delivery.http.request.duration` | s | `method`, `host`, `result` | How long an attempt took, redirects and response body included. |
| `osdu_delivery.http.retries` | `{retry}` | `method`, `host`, `reason` | Calls repeated after a passing failure: a status code, `transport` or `timeout`. |
| `osdu_delivery.probes` | `{probe}` | `flow`, `partition`, `interface`, `outcome` | Scheduled target probes settled: `reachable`, `unreachable`, `error`, `cancelled`. |

`partition` is the partition the record's ledger is kept in (empty when it is not known), so a flow delivering to several
partitions reads per partition or as one. These are rates to watch and alert on; the delivered, pending, held and failed
counts the GUI and the CLI show come from the ledger, never from here. On any process,
`dotnet-counters monitor --counters SqlFlow.Delivery -p <pid>` reads them whatever is configured.

### Where the metrics go

Nothing leaves the process until a deployment names an exporter. The control plane reads the `Osdu:Telemetry` section; a
node reads the same settings from its environment.

| Setting (`Osdu:Telemetry:`) | Node variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Exporter` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_EXPORTER` | `None` | `None`, `Otlp`, `AzureMonitor` or `Console` (case does not matter). |
| `OtlpEndpoint` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` defaults | `http://collector:4317` for grpc, `http://collector:4318/v1/metrics` for httpprotobuf. |
| `OtlpProtocol` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | `grpc` | `grpc` or `httpprotobuf`. |
| `OtlpHeadersRef` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_OTLP_HEADERS` | none | `key=value` headers a hosted backend takes its key in, as a secret reference. |
| `AzureMonitorConnectionRef` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_AZURE_MONITOR_CONNECTION` | none | The Application Insights connection string as a secret reference; required for `AzureMonitor`. |
| `ExportSeconds` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_EXPORT_SECONDS` | `60` | Seconds between exports; at least 5. |
| `ServiceName` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_NAME` | `osdu-delivery` | What a backend groups the metrics under. |
| `ServiceInstanceId` | `OSDU_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_INSTANCE` | the machine name | Tells replicas apart. |

A setting that is wrong stops the host with a message naming it, for example
`Osdu:Telemetry:OtlpHeadersRef must be a secret reference (${env:NAME} or ${keyvault:NAME}), not the value itself.` or,
on a node, `OSDU_TELEMETRY_EXPORTER is '<value>'; it is one of none, otlp, azuremonitor, console.` A one-shot CLI command
exports nothing.

```text
# A node exporting to an OpenTelemetry collector every 30 seconds
OSDU_TELEMETRY_EXPORTER=otlp
OSDU_TELEMETRY_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317
OSDU_TELEMETRY_EXPORT_SECONDS=30
OSDU_TELEMETRY_SERVICE_NAME=osdu-delivery-node
```

### What to alert on

- A rising share of `held` or `failed` outcomes per flow and partition.
- `5xx`, `transport` and `timeout` results per host, and any `refused` result: a URL the guard would not let a node reach
  ([environment variables](environment-variables.md)).
- A rising `waiting` share: children are delivered faster than the records they refer to; the flow's waiting count says
  whether they move.
- Any `unreachable` probe of a flow that should be delivering, and a run of `error` probes.

## Watching the targets

An OSDU can stop answering for reasons no run reveals until one is due: a rotated secret, a revoked entitlement, a moved
gateway path, maintenance. The GUI's **Probe target** (`POST /api/v1/delivery/flows/{pipelineId}/probe`) asks one
interface's target, under the flow's own credentials, whether it still answers; it calls the route's probe path (the
service's info endpoint) and writes nothing to OSDU. The same probe can run on a schedule, so nobody has to press it.

The schedule is off unless a deployment turns it on, because each pass costs a token exchange and a live request for
every interface it covers. It is configured under `Osdu:TargetProbe` on the control plane
([the control plane](control-plane.md#configuration)): `Enabled`, `IntervalMinutes` (15, never under 5), `Pipelines`
(names, comma separated; empty probes every active delivery pipeline) and `MaxPerPass` (200).

Each pass:

1. **Closes what an earlier pass left open.** A probe activity still `running` (the host stopped while it ran) is found
   again in the ledger and closed as an error, so nothing stays open across a restart.
2. **Probes each interface** of each covered flow, four at a time, through the same in-process path as the button, in the
   partition the interface delivers to. Each probe is recorded as an activity of kind `probe` by `service:schedule` and
   closed with what it found, and counted on `osdu_delivery.probes`.

The last scheduled result per flow and interface is therefore in the audit trail (the **Audit trail** page, action
`probe`, or `GET /api/v1/delivery/activities?kind=probe`). A probe
from the button answers in the request and is not recorded or counted. An `error` outcome says the probe itself could not
run (the flow file is not where its repository was synced, a credential will not resolve, the flow no longer parses),
not that the OSDU is down.
