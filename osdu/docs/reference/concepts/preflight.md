# Preflight: the checks a mapping, a flow and every record pass before anything reaches OSDU

A delivery checks what it can as early as it can, so a mistake surfaces once, with the file and the key, rather than on
every record of a run. The checks come in layers: each layer checks what only it can see, and none of them sends
anything to OSDU except the run's own probes of its target.

| Layer | When | What it needs | Where you see it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Reading the documents](#when-a-document-is-read) | every load: `sqlflow validate`, a repository sync, every run | the files | `validate`, the sync's warnings |
| [The preflight gate](#the-preflight-gate) | before any row renders | the saved template and the partition cache (the module's database) | `sqlflow check`, `preview`, `values`, every run |
| [The source tables](#the-source-tables) | when the tables are opened | the ingestion database | `sqlflow check --connect`, every run that reads the source |
| [The run's preflight](#the-runs-preflight) | when a run starts | the target, the ledger | the run's log and result |
| [Each record's render](#each-records-render) | as each record renders | the row | the record's hold reason |
| [The gate before sending](#validation-before-a-record-is-sent) | just before a record is written | the template and the records it refers to | the attempt's verdict |

If the preflight gate finds an error, nothing renders. A run's failed preflight plans and sends nothing, so fixing the
cause and running again is all it takes.

## When a document is read

Loading a flow refuses what is wrong in the document itself: unknown and duplicate keys, a floating mapping reference, a
literal password or other literal secret, a `${...}` reference in a location, malformed names and bounds, cross-key rules such as a fan-out without a primary key, and, in the
interface form, a misplaced key, an `after:` cycle or two interfaces keeping one ledger. The messages are on the
[delivery flow](../flow/delivery.md#validation-errors) and [interfaces](../flow/interfaces.md#load-errors) pages.

Loading a mapping parses its header, every node of the record tree, the `$findBy` lines, modifiers and expressions, and
refuses:

- a word the mapping language does not have, naming the one it most likely meant:
  `record.data.Name: '$form' is not a word of the mapping language. Did you mean '$from'? A property whose name starts with '$' is written $$form.`
- a map mixing the language's words with the record's properties, and a key written twice in one map;
- a condition that does not give true or false, or reads no column;
- a `{$param.<name>}` the mapping does not declare, and a mapping that does not declare `dataPartition`;
- `acl.owners`, `acl.viewers`, `legal.legaltags` and `legal.otherRelevantDataCountries` that are not literal lists of at
  least one text value without repeats. The access lists may add value nodes beside their literals; the legal lists may
  not, since the legal service checks them before a run, for every record alike:
  `record.legal.legaltags reads values with record.legal.legaltags[0], and the legal tags are a literal list: the legal service checks them before a run, for every record alike.`
- a modifier out of place, such as `id` or `ref` anywhere but last;
- an assertion (`$assert`) where a node takes none, or one that cannot mean what it says, such as `omit` on a required
  node or the incoming stage on a value the cache gives
  ([mapping assertions](../flow/mapping-assertions.md#errors-when-the-mapping-is-read));
- a search or a lookup that is read and not declared, or declared and not read:
  `search 'Wellbore' is declared and nothing reads it; a search costs a call to the platform for every value it is asked about, so one nothing reads is a mistake rather than spare capacity.`

These need no catalog, so `sqlflow validate` on a folder checks every flow and mapping in it offline. `validate` also
finds and reads the mapping a delivery flow pins and the dictionaries a cache or dimension flow names, as a run finds
them, and refuses a flow whose file is missing; a repository sync and a run keep such a flow and report the missing file
in their own terms. What a mapping writes is described on [mapping](../flow/mapping.md) and its pages.

## The preflight gate

Before any row is rendered, and with no OSDU call, the mapping is judged against its pinned template, the partition's
cache and the flow's parameters. Resolving the render inputs first refuses a missing input:

| Input | Message |
| --- | --- |
| The template the mapping pins | `mapping WellLog@1.0.0 pins template osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0 version 26a3c3441882db4f, which is not saved. Save it on the Templates page, or with 'sqlflow template import'.` |
| A cache for a mapping that reads one | `mapping WellLog@1.0.0 reads the cache of partition 'dev', which holds no version yet. Refresh a cache flow that builds it (...) to capture one.` |
| A pinned cache version | `render.cacheVersion pins version <v> of the cache of partition 'dev', which the catalog does not hold.` |
| The module's database | `... templates live in the module's database, which this host was started without. ...` |

Then the gate checks, collecting every finding:

1. **The template version.** The template given is the one the mapping pins, at the content version it names.
2. **Searches.** Every search resolves against the schema it pins, and every property its `$findBy` lines compare can be
   matched exactly on the platform, as that schema says the property is indexed.
3. **Every property is a variable of the template.** It exists at that version, it is not one OSDU Delivery writes
   (`id`, `kind`) or OSDU sets (`version`, `createTime`, `createUser`, `modifyTime`, `modifyUser`), and it is not a list
   of objects inside another list's items.
4. **Shapes agree.** A `$forEach` fills a list of objects; a single value fills a scalar or a list of values; a literal
   object or list fills an object or a list; a `$findAll` fills a list. Inside an open object the mapping's own shape
   stands.
5. **What the last modifier gives is what the variable takes.** `equals` fills a boolean, `number` a number, an integer
   or unformatted text, `date` text of a date format, and `id` or `ref` text. A text value written to a date or date-time
   without the `date` modifier is a warning.
6. **Every cached type exists** in the cache version the render reads, holds the field the node reads, and holds at
   least one of the fields `$findBy` compares (a field it does not hold is a warning; a type holding none of them is an
   error). A replace reading the cache reads a table the version holds, on fields it holds; values a replace can give that
   then find nothing in the cache are listed as a warning. An `id` modifier's cache token reads a lookup table the version
   holds, at a field its rows hold.
7. **References resolve to the right entity type.** A `$cache: <Type>.id` node, a search, a cached field written to a
   relationship, an `id` or `ref` modifier and a literal on a relationship each give ids of an entity type the
   relationship allows (`data.WellboreID` takes only `master-data--Wellbore`), matching the variable's pattern. A literal
   id, and the ids a cached field holds, must exist in the cache version when it holds that entity type. A `ref` settles
   one entity type.
8. **Every property the template requires in `data` has a node**, and none of those nodes may leave it out
   (`$required: false`); an object the template requires may instead be filled through its properties, at least one of
   which renders on every row:
   `template osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0 requires osdu.data.<Property>, which the mapping does not fill.`
9. **Parameters.** Every parameter the mapping requires has a value (`mapping parameter '<name>' is required and the
   flow supplies no value.`), the flow supplies none the mapping does not declare, and every `{$param.<name>}` token and
   `$param.<name>` an expression reads has a value.
10. **Columns.** When the flow's tables are known (a run that reads them), every column and child dataset the mapping
    reads exists in them, the key's, the label's, the expressions' and the columns its assertions' conditions read
    included.
11. **Assertions.** Each record-stage condition of a node's `$assert` suits the type of the value its property carries
    (a list judged value by value, a list of objects only by `exists`, `empty` and `length`, an object only by `exists`
    and `empty`), compares with values the property can hold, and every `where` field is a property of the template
    whose condition suits it:
    `<file>: record.data.SamplingStart.$assert[0]: 'data.SamplingStart' is a number in osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0 (template 26a3c3441882db4f); matches compares text.`
    See [mapping assertions](../flow/mapping-assertions.md#the-preflight).

When the tables are open a run also checks the flow against them: `source.record.key` names the mapping's `dataset.key`
columns in the same order, the scope, `lastModified` and payload columns exist, and the mapping writes nothing under a
data key `target.protocolOptions.preserveDataKeys` carries over from OSDU.

A failure lists every error at once:

```text
flows/welldb-welllog-03-delivery.yaml: preflight failed with 1 error(s):
  - mappings/WellLog@1.0.0.yaml: record.data.LogName fills a variable that template osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0 version 26a3c3441882db4f does not have.
```

Warnings do not stop a run; a run writes them to its log once. `sqlflow check` runs the gate without the source columns
and prints what the flow renders with: the mapping, the template, the cache version, the render context hash, the
mappings folder and, for a source with interfaces, each interface's route, ledger and order
([sqlflow check](../cli/check.md)). Templates and their versions are on [templates](templates.md).

## The source tables

Opening the source (a run that reads it, `sqlflow check --connect`, `sqlflow preview`, `sqlflow values`) reads the
tables' columns and refuses a table the node cannot see, a column the flow names that a table does not hold, a key column
that cannot be compared, a non-date `updated` column, a declared primary key that is not the table's integer identity
primary key, a record key without an unfiltered unique index when a primary key is declared, a row in the run's scope
with a null key column, and a database that refuses snapshot isolation under `isolation: snapshot`. Each message names
the key and the table, and, where a statement fixes it, gives it ([delivery flow](../flow/delivery.md#the-identity-primary-key)).

## The run's preflight

A run checks, before it plans anything:

- that its route can deliver the kind its mapping renders: a dataset kind on the `dataset` route, never on the `file`
  route; a DSPDM row only on the `dspdm` route; an Energistics object only on the `etp` route; a kind some DDMS the flow
  reaches serves, on a route through a DDMS ([routes](../flow/routes.md));
- for a source with interfaces, every selected interface at once: the ledger can be read, each mapping, template and
  cache resolves, each route suits its kind, the interfaces have an order ([order](../flow/interfaces.md#order)), each
  record table has the shape it needs, and, for an operation that reaches the target, each route's service answers and
  accepts the credentials (a service that cannot be reached, answers 5xx or refuses with 401 or 403 is a finding; another
  client error on its probe path is noted, not refused);
- for a run that plans to deliver (deliver, replan, intake), the mapping's legal tags with the legal service, unless
  `protocolOptions.validateLegalTags` is `false` ([protocols](protocols.md#before-a-run-the-legal-tag-check)):
  `The legal service refuses 1 of the legal tag(s) mapping WellLog@1.0.0 puts on every record, so nothing was planned or sent: ...`

A source's findings come back together:
`The preflight of 'welldb-03-delivery' found 2 problem(s), so nothing was planned or sent: interface 'wellbores': ... | interface 'welllogs': ...`

## Each record's render

The render holds a record, with every reason, when it cannot be delivered as it stands: an empty key column, a value that
cannot take its variable's type, a property the template requires rendered empty, a reference it cannot resolve, an id
whose shape, pattern or entity type is wrong, a child dataset over its row ceiling, a deleted row, or a route's own rules
(the Wellbore DDMS's, External Data Services'). Held records keep their reasons in the ledger; records held the same way
share one issue ([record lifecycle](record-lifecycle.md)). `sqlflow values` renders every row of a scope and reports
these, variable by variable, before a run does ([sqlflow values](../cli/values.md)).

The render also judges the mapping's assertions ([mapping assertions](../flow/mapping-assertions.md)): an incoming one
as its node reads the row, a record-stage one on the assembled record. A failure whose action is `omit` leaves its value
out of the document there; what the others found travels with the document to the check before sending, which holds the
record for a failure whose action is `hold`. A render never holds a record for an assertion.

## Validation before a record is sent

Immediately before a try writes a record's document, the gate checks the document against the template of its kind at
the version it was rendered for (whatever the flow pins now), as the route will send it. It applies every rule of JSON
Schema that OSDU's schemas use: types, formats, patterns, enumerations, constants, lengths, bounds, item counts and
uniqueness, required properties at every depth, properties an object does not allow, the forms a `oneOf` or `anyOf`
allows, and the entity types a relationship allows. The records the document refers to are looked up once for each group
of records sent together: in the ledger first, then in OSDU's storage service under `target.verifyReferences: storage`,
else in the cache version the flow renders with, for the entity types it captures.

| Verdict | When |
| --- | --- |
| `valid` | every rule that applies was checked and met |
| `invalid` | a rule is broken, or the document refers to a record that the cache (or storage, when asked) does not hold |
| `unverified` | nothing is broken and some part could not be checked: a pattern no regular expression dialect reads, a check that ran out of time or walked past its bounds, a reference nothing could answer for, or no saved template of the kind at that version |
| `notValidated` | the try sends the payload alone, so nothing of the document is sent or checked |

`target.validation` decides which verdicts hold the record; every verdict is recorded on the try's attempt, and the record
keeps the last outcome:

| Setting | What the gate does |
| --- | --- |
| `mode: report` (default) | sends every record and records its verdict |
| `mode: enforce` | holds an `invalid` record with its document kept |
| `unverified: send` (default) | sends an `unverified` record and records what was not checked |
| `unverified: hold` | holds an `unverified` record as `enforce` holds an invalid one |

A held record's reason names the rules it breaks by the property path every record shares, so records broken the same way
share one issue:

```text
validation: the record breaks the schema of osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0: <path> <rule>: <message>; and 2 more. validation.mode is enforce, so it is held; release it to send this document as it is, or correct the source or the mapping.
```

Releasing a record the gate held accepts its document as it is: it is sent whatever its verdict says, and the verdict
records that it was accepted. A document rendered differently later is judged again. What the route itself fills when it
sends a record (the dataset list of a route that registers files or datasets, the dataset properties the Dataset service
fills, the data keys an update carries over from OSDU, and the bulk link a DDMS manages) is not judged as it was rendered.
A run's trace counts the verdicts by template and names the rules broken most often, rather than writing a line per
record. In the interface form, an interface's `validation` block lays its keys over `target.validation`.

### A mapping's assertions

What the mapping's assertions found of the document when it was rendered joins the verdict as `assertions`: how many
judgements were made, how many failed, held, were reported and left out, and the failures (at most 50 listed, every one
counted). They are judged beside the schema, not by it, so the verdict's outcome still says what the schema check came
to. A failure whose action is `hold` holds the record with its document kept whatever `target.validation` says, under an
error that names the property, the assertion and the value; when the policy holds the record for its schema too, the
error says both:

```text
assertion: the record fails what its mapping WellLog@1.4.0 asserts: data.VerticalMeasurement.VerticalMeasurement fails "reference-elevation" with '312'. Its mapping holds a record that fails them (onFail: hold), so it is held; release it to send this document as it is, or correct the source or the mapping.
```

A release accepts the document as it is, whatever its assertions found. A try that sends the payload alone judges no
assertion, and a document queued before mappings could assert carries no findings. The record keeps how many judgements
failed on the last document checked (`AssertionFailures`, [ledger](ledger.md)), and the run's trace adds per template how
many documents failed an assertion and the assertions failed most. See
[mapping assertions](../flow/mapping-assertions.md#the-check-before-sending).

### References checked in storage

`target.verifyReferences: storage` is for a source that must not write a reference to nothing. The ids a document refers
to that no record of the ledger holds are asked of OSDU's storage service before the record is sent, and a record naming
one storage does not hold is held whatever `target.validation` says:

```text
refers to dev:master-data--Wellbore:WB-0099 (data.WellboreID), which neither the ledger nor OSDU's storage service holds; target.verifyReferences is storage, so the record is not sent with a reference to nothing. Release it once the records it names exist.
```

An id a record of the ledger holds and has not delivered yet is not held but waited for
([records that wait for records](../flow/interfaces.md#records-that-wait-for-records)). The setting is refused on the
`dspdm` route, whose rows refer to no storage record.
