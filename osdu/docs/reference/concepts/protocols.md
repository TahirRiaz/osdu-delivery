# How a delivery runs on any route: resumable steps, payload parts, legal tags and unfinished deliveries

A delivery flow sends its records by one of ten routes: `storage`, `file`, `dataset`, `manifest`, `ddms`,
`fileAndDdms`, `manifestAndDdms`, `workflow`, `dspdm` and `etp`. A flow in the single form names its route with
`target.protocol`; an interface of a source gets one from what it declares. What each route sends, and its keys, is on
[Routes](../flow/routes.md); the DDMSs the `ddms` routes reach are on [DDMSs](../flow/ddms.md) and
[DDMS shapes and services](../flow/ddms-services.md). This page is what every
route does the same way: identity, rendering, change detection, the ledger and the preflight gate never depend on the
route, and every route reports its work to the ledger in the same form.

## What a route does with a record

Each route is code, parameterised by the flow, and answers the same set of operations. The operations a run, a verify
pass, the record pages and a removal ask of it are these:

| Operation | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Deliver | Sends one record, or a batch of records where the service takes arrays, and reports every step. |
| Verify | Reads the record back and compares the version OSDU holds with the one the ledger recorded. The `storage`, `file`, `dataset`, `manifest`, `manifestAndDdms` and `workflow` routes read up to 100 ids per request (`POST /api/storage/v2/query/records`), so a drift pass costs a handful of requests; `ddms` and `fileAndDdms` read each record from its DDMS; `dspdm` reads rows by the key DSPDM gave them, and `etp` lists each dataspace's objects once. |
| Read back | Returns the record as the target holds it. |
| Remove | Takes the record out of OSDU at one of three scopes: `record` (reversible), `history` (earlier versions purged) or `everything` (the record and every version purged). What each scope calls differs by route; see [Routes](../flow/routes.md#what-a-removal-does). |
| Probe | Asks the services the route reaches whether they answer, with the flow's credentials. |
| Undo | Takes back what an unfinished delivery left in OSDU ([below](#when-a-delivery-does-not-complete)). The `storage` route makes one atomic write and has nothing to undo. |
| Restore | Writes a record back as OSDU held it at an earlier version, for a reversal. Only the `storage` route, and the `ddms` route for Wellbore DDMS records under a platform endpoint, can; the others refuse, naming why ([Removal and reversal](removal-and-reversal.md)). |

## Why a route is code the flow parameterises, not steps the flow writes

A flow names its route and tunes it; it never writes the sequence of calls. `target.protocol` picks one of the ten named
routes, the engine builds that route's implementation from the flow (`ProtocolFactory`), and a name it does not know is
refused (`target.protocol '<name>' is not a known protocol.`). What a flow can change is the route's parameters:
`target.protocolOptions` (the paths, methods and switches each route reads, such as `recordPath`, `recordMethod`,
`dataPath` and `sessionPath`), `target.ddms`, `target.workflow`, `target.dspdm` and `target.etp`. None of them adds,
removes or reorders a call.

The order of the calls stays in code because of what the calls carry between them. A bulk session's id goes into every
chunk URL and the commit, a file registration's dataset id goes into the record, a workflow run id is polled until it
ends, and each of these is a step the ledger records so a retry resumes after it ([Steps and returned
values](#steps-and-returned-values)). A document that threaded one response into the next request would need variable
scoping, per-step error handling and conditionals, and the resume, the intents before minted ids and the undo of an
unfinished delivery would then depend on how each flow wrote its steps. As named code, every route resumes, undoes and
reports the same way whatever flow runs it, and the parameters it takes are operational: they enter no render context
and redeliver nothing ([Change detection](change-detection.md#render-affecting-versus-operational)).

A target that needs a different sequence gets a route or a DDMS shape of its own in code
([DDMS shapes and services](../flow/ddms-services.md)), not a configurable step list.

## Steps and returned values

Every route reports each step that changes the target (a record write, an upload, a registration, a session, a workflow
trigger, a row save) as soon as it completes, with what the target returned. The worker writes the step onto the record
before the route moves on, so a crash never repeats a completed step and never loses an id a step minted. A retry of the
same pending work resumes after the last step that succeeded:

- a file the previous try uploaded is registered, not uploaded again;
- a Wellbore DDMS record the previous try wrote is not written again, and its bulk data goes next;
- a workflow run the previous try triggered is polled, not triggered again;
- a registration whose answer was lost is looked up (by its landing-zone path, through the search service) instead of
  registered a second time.

Three places in the `osdu` schema keep this:

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `osdu.Record.PendingStepJson` | The completed steps of the pending delivery and what each returned, keyed by step. A retry reads it. |
| `osdu.Attempt.ResultJson` | Every step of one try, in order: its name, when it started and ended, the status the target answered, the values it returned, whether it was resumed from an earlier try, and its error. |
| `osdu.Record.TargetStateJson` | The values the target returned, merged over every delivery of the record: the record id and version, dataset ids, file sources, a session id, workflow run ids, a DSPDM row key, an ETP URI. A verify, a removal and an undo read it. |

The step names are what `sqlflow records show` and the record's history in the GUI list. The main ones:

| Route | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `storage` | `records` |
| `file` | `upload-<n>` and `register-<n>` per file, `record-intent`, `records` |
| `dataset` | `storage-<set>` (the files staged, `<set>` being the payload set's name), `register-intent`, `register`, and `records` for a record written through storage |
| `manifest` | `upload-<n>` and `register-<n>` per file, `indexed`, `manifest`, `workflow`, `records`, `manifest-removed` |
| `ddms` (Wellbore DDMS) | `metadata-intent`, `metadata`, `session`, `bulk`, `payload` |
| `ddms` (other shapes) | `metadata` and the shape's own: `version` (Well Delivery), `content-<type>` (RAFS), `points-<n>` (historian), `lock`, `register`, `upload`, `close` (Seismic Store), `sync`, `rows-begin`, `rows-<n>`, `rows-done` (Reservoir Management) |
| `workflow` | `anchor-intent`, `anchor` (with `storage-<set>` when the anchor is registered with its files), `register-<input>`, `stage-<n>`, `results` |
| `dspdm` | `find`, `save-begin`, `save` |
| `etp` | `dataspace`, `transaction`, `objects`, `arrays`, `commit-intent`, `commit`, `fill`, `lock` |

A step whose name ends in `-intent` is written before a call whose id the service chooses, so the ledger knows what to
look for when the answer is lost ([When a delivery does not complete](#when-a-delivery-does-not-complete)).

## Payload parts

Most routes send at most one payload set beside the record, and the ledger keeps it as one folder and one content hash.
Four routes send their payload in parts:

| Route | Parts |
| --- | --- |
| `fileAndDdms` | `files`, then `bulk` |
| `manifestAndDdms` | `files` (when the flow declares them), then `bulk` |
| `workflow` | `files` (the anchor's own files, when declared), one part per workflow input, and the workflow run itself |
| `etp` | `files` (the object's XML) and `bulk` (the values of its arrays), each optional |

The plan resolves each part's folder and content hash from the record's row, as it does for a single payload. The record's
payload hash is a hash of the parts' hashes, so a change to any part is a payload change, and the pending payload lists
each part with its location and hash. The record's target state keeps the hash each part was last delivered with
(`payload.<set>`), and a delivery sends a part only when its hash differs from that one. New curves therefore do not
upload a record's files again, and new files do not send its curves.

A part also goes whatever its hash says when the work forces it: the record never delivered its payload, the flow sends
its payload every time (`change.payloadDetect: always`, or `change.onUnchanged: deliver`), or a redelivery names the part
(`files`, `bulk` or `workflow`). A workflow input declared `optional: true` that a record names no folder for is a part
without files. How a change is detected in the first place is on [Change detection](change-detection.md).

## Before a run: the legal tag check

Every record a mapping renders carries the same legal tags, and the storage service refuses a record whose tag is
unknown or expired, on every record that carries it. So the runs that plan or send (`deliver`, `intake` and `replan`)
ask the legal service about the mapping's tags first (`POST /api/legal/v1/legaltags:validate` under the endpoint, at most
25 names per request, which is the service's own limit). When it refuses any tag, the run fails before anything is
planned or sent:

```text
The legal service refuses 1 of the legal tag(s) mapping WellLog@1.0.0 puts on every record, so nothing was planned or sent: dev-welldb-public: <the reason the service gives>
```

A run over the interfaces of a source asks for each interface during its preflight, which reports every problem it
found at once (`The preflight of '<flow>' found <n> problem(s), so nothing was planned or sent: ...`).

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `target.protocolOptions.validateLegalTags: false` | The run does not ask, and logs that the tags were not checked. The storage service then refuses a bad tag record by record. |
| `target.protocolOptions.legalValidatePath` | Where to ask: a path under the endpoint, or an absolute http(s) URL. Needed only by a `ddms` flow whose endpoint is the DDMS itself (no `ddmsRoot`, no DDMS root under `target.ddms`), which does not reach the legal service by a path. Without it such a flow logs that the tags were not checked. Not checked is never read as valid. |

A verdict on a tag is kept for ten minutes, so the batches of one run do not ask again. The service answers 404 for a
request naming tags it does not know without saying which, so such a request is asked again name by name. A 404 that is
not the legal service's own error body (a gateway, a facade in front of a DDMS) fails the run as the service being
unreachable, not as every tag being invalid. A mapping of DSPDM rows renders no legal tags, and its runs skip the check.

## What happens when a try fails

A call that still fails after the executor's own repeats ([below](#requests-every-route-makes)) ends the try. The worker
then leaves the record pending for a later try with backoff, holds it until an operator releases it (a status no retry
can fix, or a rule the route checks before sending), or fails it once `reliability.retry.attempts` tries are used. Which
statuses do which, the record backoff, waiting records and releases are on
[Record lifecycle](record-lifecycle.md#retry-hold-fail).

## Requests every route makes

All routes send their HTTP requests through one executor, so these rules hold on every route:

- **What is repeated inside one call.** A request is repeated only when repeating it is safe: by its method (GET, HEAD,
  PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) or because the route declares the call safe by the service's own semantics (a record write under a
  client-supplied id, a reversible delete, a read by id, a search, the whole-bulk write of the Wellbore DDMS, a workflow
  trigger that names its own run id). It is repeated on 408, 425, 429, 503 and 504 and on a transport failure. 500 and
  502 are not repeated inline: the services answer them for deterministic failures as often as for passing ones, so they
  fall to the record's own backoff.
- **Never repeated.** A call whose service mints something on every accepted request: a file registration
  (`POST /api/file/v2/files/metadata`), a bulk session create, a session chunk and a session commit, and the uploads a
  storage provider takes by POST or PATCH. Not after a status, and not after a transport failure either.
- **Retry-After.** A wait the service asks for is never shortened (unless `reliability.retry.honorRetryAfter` is false,
  which ignores the header). A wait within `reliability.retry.maxDelayMs` is the
  floor of the backoff; a longer one travels with the failure, and the record's next try is no sooner than the service
  asked.
- **Content-Type.** Every request carries one, a bodiless request included, because the storage service answers a
  request without one with 415.
- **Redirects.** Followed by the executor, at most five. Every hop passes the URL guard (the scheme, the addresses the host
  name resolves to, `reliability.urlAllowlist`); a redirect from https to http is refused; a hop to another host carries
  none of the request's credentials or the flow's headers.
- **Addresses.** A connection opens only to an address the deployment reaches; `SQLFLOW_DELIVERY_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` names
  the private networks a node may reach ([Environment variables](environment-variables.md)). A refused address fails
  the request at once, without a retry.
- **Errors.** Every error the executor raises (a refused status, a transport failure, a timeout, a redirect loop, a
  refused URL, a response over `reliability.maxResponseBytes`) names the request URL without its user info, query
  string or fragment, so a signed URL's credential or a URL's password stays out of it, and carries what the service
  said (its error body read for the message) rather than raw JSON. The transport's own message is redacted too. Every
  error is redacted again before the ledger stores it. The redactor removes bearer tokens and the value of every other
  Authorization scheme, a URL's password, and every query parameter, `name=value` pair or JSON field named as a secret
  or a signer: passwords, secrets, tokens, assertions, signatures and API or account keys, an Azure shared access
  signature (`sig`, `sv`, `se`, `sp`, `sr`), S3's `X-Amz-Signature`, `X-Amz-Credential`, `X-Amz-Security-Token`,
  `AWSAccessKeyId` and `Signature`, and Google Cloud Storage's `X-Goog-Signature`, `X-Goog-Credential` and
  `GoogleAccessId`.

## Retries while a payload streams

The executor never takes a built request. Every caller hands it a factory, and the executor calls that factory once for
every attempt and once more for every redirect it follows, so each request that goes out is new, with a body of its own.
A payload body is a stream the factory opens at that moment (a file of the payload's folder, a staged chunk) wrapped in
a stream content with a 64 KiB copy buffer, and with the payload's length as its `Content-Length` when the length is
known, so the upload is not sent chunked and a landing zone that needs the length gets it. A retry therefore opens the
file again and sends it from its first byte. No payload is buffered in memory: what uploads cost a node is the requests
in flight times the copy buffer, not the size of the files. Streaming and retry need no trade-off between them.

What else is built afresh with each request:

- **The hops of a redirect.** Each hop is a new request from the factory, checked by the URL guard first. A 300, 301 or
  302 answer to a POST, and a 303 answer to anything but a GET or HEAD, turn the hop into a GET, and the body the factory
  opened for it is closed unsent; a 307 or 308 keeps the method and sends the body again. A redirect status the route
  takes as an answer (a resumable upload's 308) is not followed.
- **A signature.** A request a route signs itself for an object store (a shared access signature, a key the service
  handed out) is signed again on each attempt.
- **The token.** A 401 drops the flow's cached token and sends the call once more, with all its attempts, under a fresh
  one; a 401 that survives the fresh token is a real authorisation failure. A request to a signed URL carries no token
  of the flow and is not sent again on a 401.

Every request of an attempt, each hop included, is closed when the attempt ends, which closes its stream, and the
response is released before the wait, so an attempt that is repeated holds no connection and no open file through its
backoff. Each attempt also takes its turn under `reliability.rateLimitRps`.

**What is repeated.** Only a request that is safe to repeat ([above](#requests-every-route-makes)) is repeated; one that
is not is decided as though it were on its last attempt.

| What ended the attempt | Repeated |
| --- | --- |
| 408, 425 or 429 | Yes. A request that is otherwise not repeated is repeated after these only where the route says the service refused it unread (a search cursor's next page, which the service answers once) |
| 503 or 504 | Yes |
| A transport failure: DNS, the connection, TLS, a response cut off while its body was read | Yes |
| The request's timeout (`reliability.timeoutSeconds`) | Yes |
| Any other status, 500 and 502 included | No; the try ends and the record's own backoff takes over ([What happens when a try fails](#what-happens-when-a-try-fails)) |
| An address or URL the guard refuses, a redirect loop, a response over `reliability.maxResponseBytes` | No |

**How many times, and how long between.** A request gets `reliability.retry.attempts` attempts in all, the first
included (4 by default). The wait after attempt *n* is `retry.baseDelayMs` times 2 to the power *n* - 1 under
`backoff: exponential`, or `retry.baseDelayMs` every time under `backoff: fixed`, never more than `retry.maxDelayMs`
(500 and 30000 milliseconds by default).

**Retry-After.** The header is read as seconds or as an HTTP date. A wait it asks for within `retry.maxDelayMs` is the
floor of the wait: the executor waits the longer of it and the backoff. A longer one is not waited out inline, since it
would pin a worker for as long as the service likes: the request stops at once, and the wait travels with the failure,
as it does when the attempts are used up, so the record's next try is no sooner than the service asked.
`retry.honorRetryAfter: false` ignores the header.

## When a delivery does not complete

A delivery of one record can take several calls that each change OSDU, and OSDU has no transaction across them, so each
route records every object a delivery creates, or sets out to create, as an artifact of a unit of work (with an intent
before a call whose id the service mints), and a unit that does not complete is undone at the route's reversible scope.
When an undo runs, what it removes and keeps, how it is retried, and the commands that list and force it are on
[Unfinished deliveries and their undo](removal-and-reversal.md#unfinished-deliveries-and-their-undo).
