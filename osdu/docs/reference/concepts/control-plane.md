# The control plane: what OSDU Delivery adds

OSDU Delivery's control plane is SQLFlow's control plane with the OSDU module composed in. The host
(`osdu/hosts/SqlFlow.Delivery.ControlPlane.Host`) is one line: SQLFlow's `ControlPlaneHost` run with the product's branding
and `DeliveryControlPlaneModule`. The API surface, authentication and policies, health probes, rate limiting, CORS and
proxy handling, the `ControlPlane` configuration section, first-run bootstrap, managed git sync, the scheduler, the
dispatcher and the node protocol are SQLFlow's, unchanged, and documented in
[SQLFlow's control plane page](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/control-plane.md). That includes running a
single replica, because the run queue has one owner.

This page covers what the module adds: its database, the reads it answers in process, the configuration it attaches to
runs, its background services and its `Osdu:*` settings. The routes themselves are listed in
[the delivery API](api.md).

## What the module registers

| Addition | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| The `osdu` module database | The ledger, mappings, templates, caches, partitions and the central configuration, in schema `osdu` with its own migrations and version. Bootstrap migrates it after SQLFlow's catalog, and readiness stays red until it verifies against this build. |
| The OSDU flow kinds | The delivery, retrieval, cache, assertion, dimension and inventory kinds, their executors and their compute operations, so the repository sync projects them as pipelines and the dispatcher hands their runs to nodes. |
| The delivery routes | Every route under `/api/v1/delivery`, mapped into SQLFlow's `read`, `operate` and `author` groups, which all admit any signed-in user, with the admin routes on the `admin` policy, the only one that checks a scope ([authentication and identity](authentication-and-identity.md)). |
| The central configuration | Attached to every delivery, retrieval, cache, assertion and dimension run as it is queued (below). |
| A `records` search category | The delivery records category of SQLFlow's `GET /api/v1/search/all`, answered from the ledger's indexed lookup. |
| The assistant's tools | When `ControlPlane:Assistant:Mcp:AllowedTools` is left at SQLFlow's GUI default, the chat assistant is given SQLFlow's metadata tools and the `delivery_*` read tools ([the MCP server](../guides/mcp.md)). A list a deployment configures is kept. |
| The OSDU data definitions | A local copy of the Open Group's public schema repository, which the Templates page browses and saves templates from. |
| Metrics export | Where the module's meter goes, when a deployment names an exporter ([run trace and metrics](run-trace-and-metrics.md)). |

### The module database and its connection

The connection is resolved once, at composition:

1. `Osdu:Database:Connection`, when set: a `${env:NAME}` or `${keyvault:NAME}` reference, never a connection string.
2. Otherwise `${env:SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB}`, when that variable is set.
3. Otherwise the catalog's own connection (`ControlPlane:Catalog:ConnectionReference`), which is what the shipped
   deployments do: one metadata database, the `osdu` schema beside SQLFlow's catalog schema.

A value that is not a reference stops the host:
`The connection of module 'osdu' must be a secret reference, ${env:NAME} or ${keyvault:NAME}, or absent to use the catalog connection; the value given is not one (it is not shown).`
A database that is missing, behind this build, ahead of it or diverged, or a catalog without the migration the module
needs, also stops it with a message naming the migrations, for example
`The database of ... is behind this build: 2 migration(s) are not applied (...). Apply them with 'sqlflow db migrate'.`
Which database holds the schema is chosen before the first migrate; see [sqlflow db](../cli/db.md).

## Reads a person waits on run here

The control plane never delivers: runs, value checks and removals go to nodes. What a person asks of OSDU or the ingestion
tables and waits on runs in the control plane instead, as the request:

- a probe of a flow's target, a record read back, any record read by id, a record checked against its schema;
- a record's rows read from the ingestion tables, a preview, the values a scope parameter can take;
- every explorer read (types, search, fields, read, validate, referenced-by, dimension keys).

Each is given exactly what a node would be given (the flow file where the repository was synced, the interface, the
partition, who asked) and the central configuration of the flow's partition, so it reaches the same target with the same
credentials. That is why the control plane is given the flows' `${env:...}` references and
`SQLFLOW_DELIVERY_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` as a node is ([environment variables](environment-variables.md)).

The connection to a target is kept between reads: one per target (the flow and partition, endpoint, credentials,
headers, reliability and configuration together), at most 64 targets, each retired after 10 minutes unused or 30 minutes
in all, and at once on the 401 a rotated secret draws. A read is a person's, not a run's: at most two attempts, a backoff
of at most two seconds, no wait on a `Retry-After`, and an answer within 60 seconds. A failure answers 502 when OSDU or the
ingestion tables refused or failed, 504 when no answer came in time, and 422 when the flow cannot serve the request, with
every resolved secret redacted.

## The central configuration on every run

The module wraps SQLFlow's run dispatcher. Every run of a delivery, retrieval, cache, assertion or dimension flow reaches
the queue through it, whether an endpoint, a schedule fire, a fan-out group or `sqlflow trigger` put it there, and is
queued carrying the properties its repository resolves to: the values set for no partition and, for each partition, the values set for it. A run bound to a partition
resolves `${env:NAME}` from the repository's value for that partition, then the control plane's value for it, then the
repository's value, then the control plane's, and only then from the node's own environment. A compute task carries the
values of the one partition it names.

A run whose payload already carries properties keeps them. When nothing is configured, nothing is attached, and runs of
SQLFlow's own kinds pass through untouched. So do an inventory flow's runs: the dispatcher attaches nothing to them, so
an inventory flow's references resolve from the node's environment alone. The properties are set with [sqlflow config](../cli/config.md) or the API;
a property holds a value or a reference, never a secret.

## Background services

| Service | Runs | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cache update rollout | Unless `Osdu:CacheRollout:Enabled` is false | Carries approved cache changes to the records built from the old value: every `PollSeconds` it marks at most `BatchesPerPass` batches of `BatchSize` records for redelivery, in delivery-key order from each change's cursor. The marking is metadata only, a restart resumes where it stopped, and marking a record twice is the same as once. |
| Scheduled target probe | Only when `Osdu:TargetProbe:Enabled` is true | Probes every interface of every active delivery flow (or the `Pipelines` named) every `IntervalMinutes`, four at a time, through the same path as the GUI's Probe target, and records each as a `probe` activity by `service:schedule` ([watching the targets](run-trace-and-metrics.md#watching-the-targets)). |
| Data definitions warmup | When `Osdu:SchemaRepository:WarmOnStart` is true (the default) | At start, reads the release list and downloads the newest release when it is not on disk. A failure is not fatal; the Templates page asks again. |
| Interface catalog backfill | Once at start | Describes the interfaces of delivery pipelines a repository sync has not described yet, so a record's page finds its flow without waiting for the next sync. Retried every 30 seconds until a pass completes. |
| Search term refresh | Once at start | Writes the search terms of every repository with delivery flows again, keeping what people made of them; a repository with no delivery flow left loses its terms. Retried every 30 seconds until a pass completes. |
| Record identity backfill | At start, then every 6 hours | Fills the identity index for records the ledger held before the index existed, 500 records a page with a 250 ms pause between pages. |
| Record issue backfill | At start, then every 10 minutes | Sorts blocked records the ledger holds no issue for into their issues, 500 a page with a 250 ms pause. |

Every service runs on each replica that starts. The rollout and the backfills are written so two replicas at once cost
duplicated work and never a wrong result.

## Configuration

The module binds its own sections beside SQLFlow's `ControlPlane` section. Environment variables use the usual
`Osdu__Section__Key` form. Each value is validated when the host composes and again on start, and a bad one stops the host
with a message naming it, for example
`Osdu:TargetProbe:IntervalMinutes must be between 5 and 1440 (a day): every pass costs a token exchange and a request against a live OSDU for each interface of each active delivery flow.`

| Key | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Osdu:Database:Connection` | empty | A reference to the database holding the `osdu` schema; empty uses `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB`, then the catalog's database. |
| `Osdu:CacheRollout:Enabled` | `true` | `false` leaves approved changes waiting; the GUI still shows what is queued. |
| `Osdu:CacheRollout:BatchSize` | `5000` | Records marked per batch; positive. |
| `Osdu:CacheRollout:BatchesPerPass` | `2` | Batches per tick across all approved changes; positive. |
| `Osdu:CacheRollout:PollSeconds` | `60` | Seconds between ticks; positive. |
| `Osdu:TargetProbe:Enabled` | `false` | Each pass costs a token exchange and a live request per interface. |
| `Osdu:TargetProbe:IntervalMinutes` | `15` | 5 to 1440. |
| `Osdu:TargetProbe:MaxPerPass` | `200` | Interfaces probed in one pass, 1 to 1000. |
| `Osdu:TargetProbe:Pipelines` | empty | Delivery pipeline names, comma separated; empty probes every active delivery pipeline. A name no active delivery pipeline carries is logged. |
| `Osdu:SchemaRepository:ApiUrl` | `https://community.opengroup.org/api/v4/projects/osdu%2Fdata%2Fdata-definitions/` | The GitLab API of the data definitions; point it and `WebUrl` at a mirror when the control plane cannot reach the Open Group. |
| `Osdu:SchemaRepository:WebUrl` | `https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/data/data-definitions/` | Where schema file links point. |
| `Osdu:SchemaRepository:CacheDirectory` | `<temp>/sqlflow/osdu-data-definitions` | The local copy. |
| `Osdu:SchemaRepository:RefreshMinutes` | `1440` | How old the release list may get before it is read again; 1 to 10080. A sync reads it at once. |
| `Osdu:SchemaRepository:DownloadTimeoutMinutes` | `15` | One release's download; 1 to 240. |
| `Osdu:SchemaRepository:WarmOnStart` | `true` | Runs the warmup above. |
| `Osdu:Telemetry:*` | exporter `None` | Where the metrics go ([run trace and metrics](run-trace-and-metrics.md#where-the-metrics-go)). |
