# The partition cache: one versioned cache per OSDU partition, filled by cache flows and read by every delivery

OSDU Delivery keeps one cache per OSDU data partition. Every [cache flow](../flow/cache.md) that serves a partition
writes into that partition's cache, and every delivery flow that delivers to the partition reads from it while it
renders records: the reference data a mapping resolves ids against, the lookup tables it translates source values
through, the dictionaries and dimension values it reads. The cache is versioned, so every delivered record can say
exactly which cached values it was built from, and a later change to one of those values can find and redeliver exactly
the records it reaches. It lives in the module's database (the `osdu` schema), never in a repository: the cache flow
files define what is cached, and their runs fill it. Its history is bounded: every refresh prunes the records of the
versions the partition no longer needs ([Retention](#retention)).

## One cache per partition

A cache is keyed by the partition the flows reach, after references are resolved: a flow naming `partitions: [dev]`,
one whose `source.headers.data-partition-id` is `dev`, and one whose header is `${env:OSDU_PARTITION}` resolving to
`dev` all fill the same cache. A capture, an import, the repository sync and a render resolve the partition the same
way, so a flow can move from a header to named partitions and keep the cache it had. A partition name is letters,
digits, underscore, hyphen and dot, at most 200 characters, or a `${env:...}` or `${keyvault:...}` reference.

A delivery run reads the cache of the partition it delivers to ([partitions](partitions.md)). Its mapping reads each
type by name (`$cache.UnitAlias`, `$cache: UnitOfMeasure.id`), whichever cache flow filled it and whatever its origin.

## Versions

Each refresh that changes what a partition's cache holds writes a new version of the whole cache:

- **The label is the capture instant,** `20261009T012000Z`; when two captures of one partition share a second, the
  sequence is appended (`20261009T012000Z-7`).
- **The newest version is always current.** Every delivery renders against the current version unless its flow pins an
  earlier one with `render.cacheVersion`.
- **Every version stays listed,** because the render context of a delivered record names the version it was rendered
  against. A version records the cache flow and run that wrote it, who asked, where its content came from and what it
  changed. Its records are kept for the partition's [retention](#retention), then pruned.
- **A version that would change nothing is not written.** A version label enters the render context, so writing one for
  a capture that found nothing new would re-render every record built from the cache. A refresh that finds exactly what
  the current version holds writes nothing, and nothing renders again: refreshing often is free.
- **Each type carries its own content hash,** how it compares with the version before (`added`, `changed` or
  `unchanged`), and the version its content dates from. A version moves when any type or system property moves; a type
  that only rode along keeps its hash, and nothing built from it is analysed again.
- **Every load is checked.** A version whose records no longer match the hash it was written with is refused (`Version
  <v> of the cache of partition '<p>' does not match the content hash it was written with ...: its records were altered
  after the version was written, so nothing renders against it.`).

In the database a version is a row of `osdu.CacheVersion`; the records are kept by version range in `osdu.CacheItem`
(a record is stored once and a new row is written only when it changes, arrives or leaves); `osdu.CacheMember` says
which cache flow's last capture holds each record ([the ledger](ledger.md)).

## Retention

A version's records serve whoever reads that version: the Cache page browsing or comparing it, and a delivery flow
pinning it. A delivered record needs none of them once it is delivered: the values its render read stay with it in the
ledger (its cache set), and a change tag keeps the values before and after. So every refresh and every import of a
partition's cache, whether or not it writes a version, ends by pruning the records of the versions the partition no
longer needs. It keeps the records of:

- **the current version,** which every delivery renders against;
- **the version the current one replaced,** which a run that resolved the current version just before it moved may still
  load, and which the latest change is compared with;
- **every version a delivery flow pins** with `render.cacheVersion`;
- **every version replaced less than the retention ago.** A version stops being current when the next one is captured,
  and its retention runs from that instant.

The retention is the cache flow's `retentionDays` ([cache flow](../flow/cache.md#retentiondays)), 7 days when it declares
none. When several cache flows fill one partition, the partition keeps the longest any of them declares.

Pruning a version removes only the stored rows no kept version shares: a record that did not change since is one row,
kept for the versions that still hold it. Before any row goes, the version's changes (how many records of each type
changed, arrived and left) are recorded on its row, so the History tab reads exactly as it did. A pruned version then
stays listed, marked `pruned` with when, and its records can no longer be read:

| Where | What a pruned version answers |
| --- | --- |
| A delivery flow pinning it | The run fails: `render.cacheVersion pins version <v> of the cache of partition '<p>', whose records the cache's retention pruned at <time>, so nothing can render against it. Pin a version the cache still holds ('sqlflow cache list <p>' lists them), or remove render.cacheVersion to render against the current version.` The repository sync warns about such a pin too. |
| The Cache page | History lists it with its counts; its records and its comparison with the version before are not offered. |
| The API | `GET /cache/items` and `GET /cache/diff` answer `410 Gone` naming the version and when it was pruned; `GET /cache/versions` and `/cache/history` list it with `prunedUtc`. |
| `sqlflow cache list` | The version is marked `pruned`, with when. |

Pruning is safe beside everything else that touches the cache. It removes only rows a version up to the current one
closed, so a merge running beside it loses nothing, and it is repeatable: a pass cut short is finished by the next
refresh. A version a delivery flow pins is kept from the first refresh after the repository sync records the pin; until
the sync has recorded the pins of every delivery flow that may read the partition (after an upgrade, until its first
sync), the refresh prunes nothing and says why. A retention that fails is logged and reported in the run's result; the
refresh itself stands, and the next one applies the retention again.

In the database, `osdu.CacheDefinition.RetentionDays` holds what each flow declares, `osdu.CacheVersion.PrunedUtc` when
a version was pruned and `ChangesJson` what it changed, and `osdu.Interface.CacheVersion` the version each delivery
interface renders against (migration `CacheRetention`, module version 1.40.0).

## Several cache flows, one cache

Several cache flows may fill one partition, in one repository or several, so each project declares the reference data it
needs without copying another project's file. The cache holds the union of what they declare:

- **Types are shared by name.** Flows declaring a type under the same name share one type. A refresh of any of them
  fetches every path any synced flow of the partition declares for the type, so a field one project asks for is there
  for every pipeline reading the partition, and every flow's query adds records to it.
- **The newest capture of a record wins.** A captured record replaces what the cache held for it. A record the capturing
  flow no longer finds leaves the cache only when no other flow's last capture still holds it. Types a capture does not
  cover stay as they are, except a type no synced flow declares any more, which the merge removes.
- **A lookup table has one owner.** A table, dictionary or dimension type is declared by one cache flow of a partition:
  its capture replaces the whole type, so a second flow declaring it would replace the first one's rows.
- **Declarations must agree.** Two declarations of one type that disagree on the entity type, or cache one field name from
  different paths, are refused. The repository sync leaves the declaration synced second out of the catalog with a
  warning naming both flows, and a refresh of a flow that disagrees fails before it captures anything.
- **One platform per partition.** The sync warns when the cache flows of a partition search different endpoints.
- **Refreshes of one partition merge one after another.** A refresh takes the partition's merge lock, so a second waits for
  the first to commit and merges onto the version it wrote. After five minutes of waiting it gives up, keeps nothing of
  its capture, and says to run the refresh again. Refreshes of different partitions never wait on each other.
- **onChange is the strictest.** A type's changes wait for approval when any flow declaring it says `onChange: approve`.

When a flow stops declaring a type, the sync deletes that flow's hold on the type's records, so a later capture by
another flow lets go of the records only the first one kept.

## What a refresh does

1. Resolves the partition and reads every synced declaration of it; a conflict with another flow stops here.
2. Captures each declared type from its origin: OSDU types through the search service (every path the partition keeps
   for the type), table types from the ingestion database, dictionaries from the repository tree, dimension types from
   the dimension's last build. A type that cannot be read whole fails the refresh before anything is written.
3. Reads the partition's system properties, when it reached OSDU (below).
4. Merges the capture into the current version and writes the next version, unless nothing moved.
5. Applies the partition's [retention](#retention): prunes the records of the versions it no longer keeps.
6. Compares each type that moved with the version before, and tags the changes that delivered records were built from.

A run over several partitions does this for each in turn; a partition that fails leaves the others refreshed.

## From a cache change to OSDU

Every delivered record points at the set of cached values its render read: the record a value was found by, each value
written into the document, each path read that held nothing, each key a lookup table did not list, and each id written as
an unverified reference. A refresh compares
the new version with the one it replaces over those sets (thousands of them, never the records themselves) and writes
one tag per change: the partition, the type, the cached record, the path, the value before and after, the versions it
moved between, and how many delivered records it reaches.

| Change | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `changed` | A value records read now reads differently. |
| `removed` | A cached record records used is no longer in the cache. |
| `unmatched` | A record no longer matches by the value records found it by. |
| `listed` | A lookup table now lists a key records looked up and found no row under, or an OSDU type now holds a record by a value records found none by. |
| `relisted` | The rows a key finds are no longer the ones records read every one of. |
| `found` | The cache now holds a record that records reference as an unverified id. |

What a tag does depends on the type's `onChange`:

- **`auto`** (the default): the tag is approved as it is written, and each affected record is delivered again on its
  flow's next run.
- **`approve`**: the affected records are held back; a plan skips them as `awaiting approval` ("a cache change is tagged
  against this record and is waiting for approval"), so OSDU keeps the documents it has, until someone decides on the
  Cache page. Approving lets the rollout carry the change out; rejecting leaves the delivered documents alone. If the
  value moves again after an approval and before the rollout carried it, the tag reopens, because the approval was for
  the value someone looked at.

A tag's status moves through `pending`, `approved` or `rejected`, `rolling` (its records are being marked), `delivering`
(all are marked and some flow has not rendered them again yet) and `applied`.

The control plane carries approved changes out in batches, so a corrected unit that reaches millions of records drains
at a set pace and resumes after a restart. The marking is metadata only: no payload is re-uploaded because a reference
value changed.

| Setting (`Osdu:CacheRollout`) | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Enabled` | `true` | Turns the automatic rollout off; approved changes then wait. |
| `BatchSize` | `5000` | Records marked for redelivery per batch. |
| `BatchesPerPass` | `2` | Batches per pass, across all approved changes. |
| `PollSeconds` | `60` | Seconds between passes. |

## System properties

A refresh that reaches OSDU also reads the partition's system properties: the feature flags the indexer and the search
service report through `GET /api/indexer/v2/info` and `GET /api/search/v2/info` (their `featureFlagStates`). They are
kept with the version, apart from the cached records: they have no record id, and no mapping reads them. The engine
relies on one, `featureFlag.keywordLower.enabled`: where the indexer keeps a lowercased copy of every text property, a
search that finds no record exactly asks again regardless of case.

- A state reported for the partition wins over one reported for no partition; states for other partitions are ignored.
- A service that cannot be asked fails nothing: the refresh logs why and keeps what the cache knew of that service. A
  property the engine relies on that no service reports is recorded as unknown, and nothing relies on it being on.
- A changed state is a change of the cache, so the refresh writes a version even when every record is the same.
- A flow of lookup tables alone reaches no platform and reads none.

## Filling a cache without a platform

For work without OSDU, `sqlflow cache import <cache flow> --from-dir <dir>` merges type files into the cache of the
flow's partition as that flow's capture, and applies the partition's retention as a refresh does
([`sqlflow cache`](../cli/cache.md)). The files stand in for what a search of
the partition would return: every record is an OSDU record of the declared entity type in the flow's partition. A lookup
table is never imported: it is captured from its table, dictionary or dimension wherever the flow runs.

## Where to see it

- **The Cache page** (OSDU, Build, Cache) shows the cache of the partition picked in the title bar: the cache flow files
  that fill it, with **Cache files** and **Refresh now** (a **Refresh** menu naming the flows when several fill the
  partition, since a refresh captures what one flow declares); and four tabs. **Records** browses what a version holds, a type
  at a time, with how a mapping reads each row. **History** lists the versions and which types each changed, a pruned
  version marked as such.
  **Deliveries** lists the changes with what they reach, the approvals waiting, and the records built without something
  the cache did not hold yet. **Setup** lists the cache flows, the types each declares, the retention each declares and
  the one the partition keeps, and the partition's OSDU feature flags.
- **A cache flow's pipeline page** opens on its **Cache versions** tab.
- **`sqlflow cache list <partition>`** prints the partition's retention, the versions, newest first, each pruned one
  marked, and the current version's system properties.
- **The API** (`/api/v1/delivery`): `GET /caches`, `/cache/versions`, `/cache/items`, `/cache/history`, `/cache/diff`,
  `/cache/tags`, `/cache/gaps`, `/cache/streams` (each type's upstream flows, from files to the cache flow, and who reads
  it), and `POST /cache/tags/decide` ([the API](api.md)).
