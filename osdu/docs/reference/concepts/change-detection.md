# Change detection: what makes an OSDU record deliver again, and what never does

A delivery flow sends a record only when what it renders to, or its payload, differs from what the ledger says OSDU
holds. Every run answers three questions in turn: which rows of the ingestion tables to read, whether a row read needs
rendering at all, and whether the rendered document or payload differs from what was delivered. Just before a worker
sends anything, it asks the last question once more. This page is what each question reads and what moves it, so an
operator can predict what a change will send and why a record was or was not delivered.

The ingestion side of the chain has its own change detection: an `ing` flow updates a row only when its row hash changed,
and stamps `UpdatedDate_DW` only then ([upsert and change detection](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/upsert-and-change-detection.md)).
A row landed again unchanged is therefore never read again by a delivery.

## Render-affecting versus operational

Only the inputs of the render enter the **render context** recorded against every record. Changing anything else
changes how a document gets to OSDU, never what it is, and redelivers nothing.

| Enters the render context | Operational (never redelivers by itself) |
| --- | --- |
| `render.mapping`, and the mapping file's content (a fingerprint of the document read as YAML: comments, layout and key order do not count, every other edit does, its `description` included) | `target.endpoint`, `target.auth`, `target.headers` |
| The template version the mapping pins (its content hash) | `target.protocol` and `target.protocolOptions` |
| The mapping's parameter values as they resolve (`render.parameters`, and the `${env:OSDU_LEGAL_TAG}`-style defaults the kind supplies) | `reliability`, `failWhen`, `verify` |
| The partition whose cache the render reads, and the cache version | `target.validation`, `target.verifyReferences` |
| For a mapping that searches the platform, the partition's system properties its searches rely on | `source.incremental`, `source.work`, `schedule` |

A moved render context makes a record render again; whether it is sent is still decided by the hash of the rendered
document alone. A mapping edit that does not change what a record renders to sends nothing, and neither does a new cache
version for a record that renders the same document under it. The records a cache change does reach are redelivered by
its rollout ([below](#cache-changes-reaching-records)). Because parameter values are resolved before the context is built, a changed
value behind a reference (a new legal tag in the configuration) moves the context of every record that uses it.

A mapping that reads nothing from a cache renders against no cache, so refreshing a cache never moves its records'
context. A mapping that only searches is pinned to the partition's system properties instead of a cache version, so a
refresh that changes reference data never renders its records again.

## Which rows a run reads

An ordinary run does not read every row. Each scope (the flow, its interface, and one set of parameter values) keeps a
watermark: the upper bound of the last whole-scope read that completed.

| Read | When |
| --- | --- |
| The whole scope | The scope has no watermark yet (its first run), the rules moved since the watermark was written (the mapping, its content, the template or the parameter values: everything in the context but the cache version), a `replan` run, or a `plan` run with `rerender` |
| The window `(watermark - overlapSeconds, now]` | Every other run. `now` is the source database's clock when the read opens, fixed for the whole read |
| The records named | A run scoped to `recordKeys`, read by the key tuple the ledger stored |
| A submission's own window | A run that names a submission: a fan-out member, a re-run, a drain |

In a window the candidates are:

- record rows whose `systemColumns.updated` (`UpdatedDate_DW`) falls in it;
- record rows the ingestion flow marked deleted in it (`DeletedDate_DW`), which it does without touching the update
  column;
- records whose child rows were updated, or marked deleted, in it, since the document is built from them too.

`source.incremental.overlapSeconds` (900 by default, 0 to 86400) reads a little below the watermark again, so a row
whose transaction committed after the previous read fixed its upper bound is still picked up. A run under moved rules
reads the whole scope once; its watermark then carries the new rules, and later runs are incremental again. A moved cache
version does not trigger a whole read: the cache rollout asks for exactly the records the change reaches (below).

Before its own read, a deliver run plans the records the ledger was asked to plan again (a release, a redelivery, a
cache rollout), by key, in passes of up to 5000, each pass in a submission of its own. Their rows did not change, so a
window would never meet them.

**Tier 0.** With `change.useSourceVersions: true` (the default), an incremental run whose window holds no candidate and
for which no record waits to be planned again completes without reading a row. Its submission completes at once and the
watermark still advances. The run log says `Tier 0: no row of OsduData.silver.WellLog changed in the window for scope
..., and no record waits to be planned again; skipping the whole run.`

## What is decided for each record read

The plan takes each record read through these steps in order; the first that applies decides it.

| Step | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| A key column is empty | Held: `dataset key incomplete: every key column must be non-empty` |
| A child dataset holds more rows than `maxRowsPerRecord` | Held, naming the dataset and the ceiling |
| The row is marked deleted | Held: a deleted row is never delivered. Removing the record from OSDU is a deliberate operation ([removal and reversal](removal-and-reversal.md)) |
| A cache change tagged against the record waits for approval | Skipped as awaiting approval; OSDU keeps the document it has |
| The record is held, failed, deleted or reverted, and the source has not moved past the version it was left at | Blocked until it is released or the source changes ([record lifecycle](record-lifecycle.md)) |
| `source.lastModified` is empty or unreadable | Held, naming the column and the value |
| `source.lastModified` is older than the version the ledger holds, delivered or queued | Skipped as **stale**, never sent; the skip is an attempt on the record's history |
| The payload's folder, files or hash cannot be resolved | Held with the reason |
| **Tier 1**: the source version, the payload hash and the render context all equal what the ledger holds for a delivered record | Skipped without rendering |
| The render holds the record (a value its template refuses, a required property empty, a reference it cannot resolve) | Held with every reason |
| **Tier 2**: the rendered document's hash and the payload hash are compared with what was delivered | Create, update metadata, update payload, update both, or skipped as unchanged |

## The versions and hashes compared

| Value | What it is | Compared by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingestion fingerprint | SHA-256 over the record row's `UpdatedDate_DW` and, for each child dataset in name order, its row count and newest `UpdatedDate_DW` | Tier 1, and whether a blocked record's source moved |
| Business version | The record row's `source.lastModified` moment, when the flow declares one | Tier 1 and the stale gate |
| Render context | The canonical JSON of the inputs in the table above | Tier 1 |
| Document hash | SHA-256 of the rendered document's canonical JSON alone | Tier 2 and the final check |
| Payload hash | The row's `hashColumn`; or, under `payloadDetect: lastModified` without a hash column, a signature over the files' names, sizes and modified times; for a route sending parts, a hash over each part's hash | Tier 2 and the final check |

A record whose source row changed but renders the document OSDU already has is not sent. The intake still records the
change on the record's history, with the row's new origin file and row.

### The business version: `source.lastModified`

A business version orders the source's rows, where the ingestion fingerprint only says they differ. A row whose moment is
later than the version the ledger holds is planned; the same moment can be skipped without rendering; an older one is
stale and never sent, so a late or re-landed row never takes OSDU back to an earlier version. The column is a `datetime`,
or RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 text (without an offset read as UTC). With it declared, a blocked record stays blocked until a
row arrives that is later than the moment it was left at.

### Payloads: `change.payloadDetect`

Under `contentHash` (the default) a payload is sent when its hash column moves. Under `lastModified` the payload's files
are its watermark: a payload is reconsidered when a file was modified after the ones already delivered or queued, or
when the set of files changed, at the cost of one storage listing per record per run; files older than what was
delivered are stale. A declared `hashColumn` stays the final check, so rewritten files with the same content are not
uploaded again. Under `always` the payload goes every time. A route that sends parts (files and bulk data) sends each
part only when its own hash moved, so new bulk data does not upload the record's files again
([routes](../flow/routes.md)).

### The change keys

| Key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `change.detect: always` | Every record read is rendered and its document sent. |
| `change.payloadDetect: always` | Every record read sends its payload. |
| `change.onUnchanged: deliver` | Every record read sends its document and payload, unchanged or not. |
| `change.useSourceVersions: false` | Turns tier 0 off: every run plans its window whatever it holds. |

None of them changes which rows a run reads. The keys and their refusals are on the [delivery flow](../flow/delivery.md#change).

## Work already queued, and the final check

A record whose newer version arrives while an earlier one is queued or being delivered does not lose it: the plan
compares the new render with what is queued as well as with what was delivered. A render identical to the queued work is
a skip; anything else replaces the queue, and the next pass of the same run sends it. Concurrent plans cannot take a
record backwards: the ledger refuses staged work older than what it holds and records it as stale.

Immediately before sending, the worker compares the claimed record's queued document and payload hashes with what was
delivered once more, since a delivery of the same content can have landed in between, and sends only the halves that
still differ. A run counts the outcomes: `skippedUnchanged`, `awaitingApproval`, `skippedStale`, `unchangedAtPush`
(found already delivered by that final check), `blocked`, `held`, `failed` and `waiting`, beside `planned` and
`delivered` ([running an OSDU flow](../cli/run.md)).

## Cache changes reaching records

A record that reads the partition cache records which cached values it was built from, kept as a shared set of values
rather than one row per record. When a cache flow's refresh finds that a value some records were built from changed,
was removed, or that a value records looked for and did not find now exists, it tags the change once:

- Under `onChange: auto` (the cache flow's default) the change is rolled out: every record built from the old value, of
  every flow, is marked in batches for a metadata redelivery (its document hash and fingerprint are forgotten), and the
  next run of each flow renders it under the new cache version and sends its document. Its payload stays as it is. The
  change is applied once no flow still builds a record from the old value.
- Under `onChange: approve` the records stay as they are, counted as awaiting approval, until someone approves or
  rejects the change on the cache page. An approval rolls it out; a rejection leaves the delivered documents alone.

A record read for another reason while its cache version moved renders against the current version anyway (its context
moved), and is sent only if it renders differently. The cache, its versions and approvals are on
[partition cache](partition-cache.md).

## A record keeps the OSDU id it claimed

A record's OSDU id is fixed when it first queues a document. A mapping edit that would give it another id (a changed
`dataset.idFrom`) holds the record, naming both ids, instead of writing a second OSDU record the ledger does not name. A
changed `dataset.system` or key makes other delivery keys, so the rows become new records of the ledger, each with its own
id; under `idFrom: key` a new record whose key gives an id an old record already claimed is held instead, since one OSDU
id belongs to one record of the ledger ([mapping](../flow/mapping.md#the-osdu-id)).

## Sending records again on purpose

| Run | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `force` in the payload | Lifts tier 0 and the completed-submission gate; each record's hashes still decide. |
| `--operation replan` | Reads the whole scope again; sends what renders differently now. |
| `rerender` with or without `recordKeys` | Asks the named records, or every delivered record, to be rendered again; sends only what renders differently. |
| `redeliver` with or without `recordKeys` | Sends the named records, or every delivered record, again whatever the hashes say: `all`, `record`, or a part (`files`, `bulk`, `workflow`). |
| `--operation sync` | Compares the ledger's records with their rows and asks the next run to plan those that changed or were marked deleted without a run seeing it; sends nothing. |

The payload keys are on [running an OSDU flow](../cli/run.md); verify, removal and reversal are on
[removal and reversal](removal-and-reversal.md).
