# Request correlation: the correlation id every OSDU request carries, from setting it up to finding a run in the platform's logs

Every request OSDU Delivery sends to an OSDU service carries a `correlation-id` header whose value says what sent it:
which repository, which operation, which run. OSDU's services on Azure log that header with everything they do for the
request, so one value finds a run in the platform's logs, and a prefix of it finds every run of a repository or a flow.

```text
correlation-id: osdu-delivery-wl-dim-01a186ef-b444-7732-bb2e-9a7f4dfd4767
                ^             ^  ^   ^
                product       |  |   the run's id
                              |  the flow's operation code
                              the repository's code
```

This page holds the whole design: the value, the two documents that set it, how to set it up, which requests carry it,
what is refused, where the value is kept, how to find a run in the platform's logs, what changed for existing flows, and
where it is built. The [repository document](../flow/repository.md) page is that document's own reference, and
[decision 0037](../../wiki/decisions/0037-request-correlation.md) says why it is built this way.

## The value

| Sent by | Value |
| --- | --- |
| A run of a flow | `osdu-delivery-<repository>-<operation>-<run id>` |
| A run of a flow with no repository document above it | `osdu-delivery-<operation>-<run id>` |
| An operation of the product's own (a probe, a read the explorer makes) | `osdu-delivery-<operation>-<id>`, a new id each time |
| A request sent outside both (a tool driving a route itself) | `osdu-delivery-<id>`, a new id per request |

### Where each part comes from

| Part | Comes from | When there is none |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `osdu-delivery` | The product: every value starts with it. | |
| The repository's code | `code` in the [repository document](../flow/repository.md), `osdu-delivery.yaml`, nearest above the flow's file. | The part is left out, and the run log says why. |
| The operation code | The flow's `telemetry.operation`. | The flow kind's code ([operation codes](#operation-codes)). |
| The run's id | The run: the id it is listed under in the GUI, the API and `sqlflow run`. Nothing new is minted for it. | |

Two files set the codes, both versioned with the flows. At the repository's root:

```yaml
# osdu-delivery.yaml
documentType: repository
code: wl
```

In a flow, only to name a code other than its kind's:

```yaml
telemetry:
  operation: whdr
```

Every request of a run carries the same value: its searches, its writes, its retries and its read-backs. One value
finds the whole run, and a prefix finds every run of a repository or a flow.

### The rule for a code

A code, the repository's or an operation's, is a lower-case letter, then lower-case letters and digits, at most 16 in
all, with no hyphen. The value therefore splits on its hyphens: `osdu-delivery`, then the codes, and the id is always
its last 36 characters. `wl`, `whdr` and `dim2` are codes; `WL`, `well-logs` and `2dim` are not.

### Operation codes

A flow of any kind names its own code under `telemetry`:

```yaml
flowType: delivery
name: welldb-welllog-03-delivery
telemetry:
  operation: whdr
```

Left out, a run carries its kind's code:

| Kind | Code |
| --- | --- |
| delivery | `dlv` |
| cache | `cache` |
| retrieval | `ret` |
| assertion | `ast` |
| dimension | `dim` |
| inventory | `inv` |
| removal | `rmv` |

The code names the flow, not the run's operation: a `plan` and a `deliver` of the same flow carry the same code, and the
run's id says which run it was. Give a flow a code of its own when its runs must be told apart from its kind's other
flows in the platform's logs.

### The product's own operations

The product's own operations carry their own code whichever flow's target they read through, and whatever repository
that flow is in:

| Code | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `probe` | A target probe (`delivery-probe`), a person's or the scheduled one's. |
| `read` | A record read back from OSDU for its record page (`delivery-read`). |
| `explore` | The explorer's reads of a partition (`delivery-explore`): types, searches, a record, validation, dimension samples. |
| `preview` | A record rendered from its source row and sent nowhere (`delivery-preview`). |
| `values` | A mapping's value check (`delivery-check-values`). |
| `row` | A record's source row (`delivery-source`), which reads the ingestion tables. |
| `scope` | The values a run form offers for a parameter (`delivery-scope-values`), read from the ingestion tables. |
| `schema` | A reading of a partition's schemas, kept for the explorer's referenced-by. |
| `signin` | The local setup's check of a flow's OSDU client (`osdu-delivery-setup`, `sqlflow dev`). |

## The repository document

The repository's code is one small file, reviewed with the flows, that does nothing on its own:

| Key | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `documentType` | yes | `repository`. |
| `code` | yes | The repository's code ([the rule for a code](#the-rule-for-a-code)). |
| `description` | no | Free text. |

A run reads the file nearest its flow's file: `osdu-delivery.yaml` (or `osdu-delivery.yml`) in the flow's folder, else
in each folder above it in turn.

- **The repository's root is as far as it looks.** The folder holding `.git` (a folder in a clone, a file in a git
  worktree) is the last one read. Without a `.git`, the walk stops after 16 folders.
- **The nearest wins.** A folder may hold a document of its own, and the flows under it take that one, so a repository
  that keeps several sources apart can give each a code.
- **The name is matched exactly**, on every host: `OSDU-Delivery.yaml` is not the document.
- **One per folder.** A folder holding both `osdu-delivery.yaml` and `osdu-delivery.yml` is refused.

[The repository document](../flow/repository.md) lists every message it is refused with.

## Setting it up for a repository

1. Add `osdu-delivery.yaml` at the repository's root, beside `.git`:

    ```yaml
    documentType: repository
    code: wl
    description: The well log flows.
    ```

2. Validate the repository. The document is read as one of its own, and every flow under it with it:

    ```text
    $ sqlflow validate .
    OK      osdu-delivery.yaml  (repository 'wl')
    OK      welldb\flows\welldb-welllog-05-dimensions.yaml  (dimension 'welldb-welllog-05-dimensions')
    2 valid, 0 broken of 2 document(s) under <folder>.
    ```

3. Optionally, give a flow an operation code of its own (`telemetry.operation`). Do it in a commit that does not also
   rename the flow: the repository sync pairs a renamed flow with its ledger by its document, and a changed document
   under a new name is another flow ([renaming a pipeline](renaming-a-pipeline.md)).
4. Commit, push and sync the repository: the Repositories page, or `sqlflow repos sync <name>`. A node runs a flow from a
   checkout of the run's commit, so runs started after the sync carry the code.
5. Run a flow. The run log's first lines say what its requests carry, and which document gave the code:

    ```text
    2026-10-29 09:13:38.658Z INFO  run   dimension flow 'welldb-welllog-05-dimensions': plan (parameters: operation plan) requested by cli:jane@host, run 01a186ef-b444-7732-bb2e-9a7f4dfd4767
    2026-10-29 09:13:38.658Z INFO  run   OSDU requests of this run carry correlation-id osdu-delivery-wl-dim-01a186ef-b444-7732-bb2e-9a7f4dfd4767, the repository's code from /repos/estate/osdu-delivery.yaml
    ```

6. Filter the platform's logs on that value ([finding a run](#finding-a-run-in-the-platforms-logs)).

## Which requests carry it

### Inside a run

Every flow kind's executor opens the run's value as the first thing it does, before it reads a source or sends a
request, and closes it when the run ends. Everything the run sends carries it:

- searches, record writes, a record's tries and retries, and its read-backs;
- undoing what an unfinished try left, removal chunks, reversal pages and source removals;
- workflow triggers and their XCom reads, and the Reservoir DDMS's ETP session;
- a product operation the run calls, which keeps the run's value rather than taking its own.

Each part of a delivery split over nodes is a run of its own and carries its own id. A record's attempt names the value
its requests carried.

The schema index is the exception: its reading of a partition's schemas serves every later ask, whichever run or
explorer ask started it, so it always carries a value of its own, `osdu-delivery-schema-<id>`.

### Outside a run

A product operation opens its own value, `osdu-delivery-<operation>-<id>`, with a new id each time. Engine work reached
outside a run's scope carries its kind's code and a new id: `osdu-delivery-dlv-<id>` for a delivery's tries, undos,
removal chunks and reversal pages, `osdu-delivery-rmv-<id>` for a source removal. Any other request carries
`osdu-delivery-<id>`, a new id per request, so no request to OSDU goes without one.

### The services and transports

| Transport | Carries |
| --- | --- |
| The OSDU services a flow's client calls: storage, search, schema, file, dataset, legal, workflow and the DDMSs | `correlation-id`, set last, over any header of that name |
| The Reservoir DDMS's ETP session | `correlation-id` on its WebSocket upgrade |
| The Airflow REST API behind the Workflow service (XCom reads) | `correlation-id` |
| The production historian | `correlation-id`, and the same value in `trace-id`, the header its contract logs a request under |
| The setup check's read of a legal tag | `correlation-id: osdu-delivery-signin-<id>` |
| The token endpoint | Nothing: it is not OSDU. |
| A location a service signed (a landing zone, a dataset's retrieval URL, an object store a DDMS hands out) | Nothing: the request carries its own authorisation and none of the flow's headers, since some object stores refuse a request that also carries a bearer. |

## What is refused

A flow cannot set the header itself. A flow's operation code or header that breaks the rules is refused wherever the
flow's document is read; a repository document that breaks them is refused by `sqlflow validate` and fails every run
under it.

| Problem | Message |
| --- | --- |
| A `correlation-id` in a `headers` block (`source.headers`, `target.headers`, `target.airflow.headers`) | `flows/welldb-retrieval-01-wellbores.yaml: source.headers names 'correlation-id', which every request of a run carries as the run sets it: osdu-delivery, the code of the repository (osdu-delivery.yaml), the flow's operation code (telemetry.operation) and the run's id. Remove the header.` |
| An operation code that breaks the rule | `flows/welldb-welllog-03-delivery.yaml: telemetry.operation 'Header-Log' is not an operation code: a lower-case letter, then lower-case letters and digits, at most 16 in all and no hyphen, so the correlation id splits on its hyphens. Leave it out to take the kind's own, 'dlv'.` |
| A repository document with no code | `osdu-delivery.yaml: code is required: the repository's code, which every run of its flows carries in its correlation id.` |
| A repository code that breaks the rule | `osdu-delivery.yaml: code 'WL' is not a repository code: a lower-case letter, then lower-case letters and digits, at most 16 in all and no hyphen, so the correlation id splits on its hyphens.` |
| A key the repository document does not take | `osdu-delivery.yaml: invalid YAML at line 3, column 1 - Property 'name' not found on type 'SqlFlow.Delivery.Documents.RepositoryYaml'.` |
| A repository document under another name | `repository.yaml: a repository document is found by its name, walking up from each flow's folder; name the file osdu-delivery.yaml.` |
| Both names in one folder | `<folder> holds both osdu-delivery.yaml and osdu-delivery.yml; a folder holds one repository document. Remove one.` |

A run of a flow under a document it cannot read fails before it sends anything, with the document's message, and
`sqlflow validate` refuses the flow for it:

```text
$ sqlflow validate welldb/flows/welldb-welllog-05-dimensions.yaml
ERROR  welldb/flows/welldb-welllog-05-dimensions.yaml: ../../osdu-delivery.yaml: code 'WL' is not a repository code: a lower-case letter, then lower-case letters and digits, at most 16 in all and no hyphen, so the correlation id splits on its hyphens.
```

## Where the value is kept

| Where | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| The run log and live trace | The run's first lines say what its requests carry, and which document gave the repository's code. |
| A record's attempt in the ledger | `correlationId` in its `ResultJson`: what the try's requests carried ([the ledger](ledger.md#osduattempt-every-try-and-every-decision-that-changed-the-record), [`osdu.Attempt`](../tables/attempt.md)). The record's Timeline and `sqlflow records show` show it. |
| A refused request's error | `(correlation-id <value>)`: the id the service answered with, else the one sent. |
| An issue's pattern | The whole value becomes `<id>`, so the same refusal in two runs is one issue ([issues](record-lifecycle.md#issues)). |
| An explorer or read-back answer | `correlationId`, the value its reads carried. |

A flow with no repository document above it says so in its run log instead:

```text
INFO  run   OSDU requests of this run carry correlation-id osdu-delivery-dim-01a186ef-b444-7732-bb2e-9a7f4dfd4767; no osdu-delivery.yaml in the flow's folder or above it names the repository's code
```

The value is kept in no column of its own: a run is listed by its id, and an attempt holds its value in its JSON.

## Finding a run in the platform's logs

On Azure, OSDU's services read the header through the platform's Azure library (`os-core-lib-azure`):

- each request's `correlation-id` goes on every log line written while the service handles it (`Slf4jMDCFilter`);
- the transaction log records it beside the partition and the content type, the only request headers it records
  (`TransactionLogFilter`);
- the messages the service publishes for others (the indexer, the workflow engine) carry it on
  (`PubSubAttributesBuilder`, `ServiceBusPublisher`).

A header of any other name would not reach those logs, which is why the value is carried in this one. Filter the logs on
the value or a prefix of it:

| To find | Filter on |
| --- | --- |
| One run | The whole value, `osdu-delivery-wl-dim-01a186ef-b444-7732-bb2e-9a7f4dfd4767`, or only the run's id |
| Every run of one repository | `osdu-delivery-wl-` |
| Every run of one flow, or of a kind's flows | `osdu-delivery-wl-dim-` |
| The product's own operations | `osdu-delivery-explore-`, `osdu-delivery-probe-`, ... |
| Everything OSDU Delivery sent | `osdu-delivery-` |

From the product's side, a failed try on a record's Timeline names the value its requests carried, so it leads to what
the service logged for it; from the platform's side, the run's id at the end of a value leads to the run in the GUI.

## What changed for existing flows

- **A repository without a document runs as it did.** Its runs' value leaves the repository's part out
  (`osdu-delivery-<operation>-<run id>`), and the run log says so. Add the document to put the code in.
- **Every OSDU flow kind runs from a checkout** of its repository at the run's commit, since every run reads the
  document. Retrieval and inventory flows, and cache flows holding no dictionary, ran from a snapshot of their one file
  before ([which kinds need the repository](../flow/overview.md#which-kinds-need-the-repository)).
- **A `correlation-id` in a flow's `headers` is refused.** A flow that set one no longer loads until the header is
  removed: the run sets the value now.
- **A flow that names no operation code keeps its document hash**, so the repository sync pairs a renamed flow with its
  ledger as before ([renaming a pipeline](renaming-a-pipeline.md)).
- **Attempts written before keep their bare GUID.** An issue's pattern turns either into `<id>`, so they group as before.

## Troubleshooting

| What you see | Why | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The run log says `no osdu-delivery.yaml in the flow's folder or above it` | No document between the flow's folder and the repository's root, or one under another spelling (`OSDU-Delivery.yaml`). | Add `osdu-delivery.yaml` at the root, named exactly. |
| The value carries another repository's code than expected | A nearer document, in a folder between the flow and the root, wins. | The run log names the document it read; move or remove the nearer one. |
| Runs still carry the old value after the document was added | The run ran a commit synced before the document. | Sync the repository; runs started after carry the code. |
| A run fails before it sends anything, with a message naming `osdu-delivery.yaml` | The document cannot be read. | Fix what the message names; `sqlflow validate .` shows it ([what is refused](#what-is-refused)). |
| A flow fails to load: `names 'correlation-id'` | The flow sets the header in a `headers` block. | Remove the header. |
| A request in the platform's logs has no `osdu-delivery-` value | A request to a signed location or the token endpoint, which carry none, or a request another client sent. | Look for the run's other requests around it by time and path. |
| A refused request's error names an id that is not `osdu-delivery-...` | The service answered with a correlation id of its own, and the error names what the service answered. | The attempt's `correlationId` is what was sent. |

## Why it is built this way

[Decision 0037](../../wiki/decisions/0037-request-correlation.md) records the reasons and the alternatives. In short:

- **`correlation-id`**, because it is the header the platform's Azure library puts on every log line of a request; any
  other name would be sent and never logged.
- **The run's id**, because the platform's operators trace executions: one value per run groups everything it sent,
  where a value per try could not be grouped from the platform's side.
- **The repository's code in one document at its root**, versioned and reviewed with the flows, rather than repeated in
  every flow or kept in the control plane's configuration outside git.
- **No refusal for a missing document**, so no estate stops until it adds one.
