# sqlflow template

OSDU Delivery's command line is `sqlflow`: SQLFlow's CLI with the OSDU verbs added. `template` is one of those verbs. It
reads a repository's template folders, where the documents of a repository read the templates they fill, writes a
template into one, and lists, shows and deletes the saved templates of the library. What a template is, how a document's
template is settled from its folders, and how versions compare is in [Templates](../concepts/templates.md); this page is
the verb.

## Synopsis

```bash
sqlflow template folders [<dir>] [--for <document>]                                      [--json]
sqlflow template capture --kind <kind> [--release <tag>] [--out <file.json>]  [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow template import <schema.json> --kind <kind> [--release <tag>] [--out <file.json>] [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow template import --from-dir <dir> --kind <kind> [--out <file.json>]    [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow template list                                                         [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow template show --kind <kind> [--version <version>] [--out <file.json>] [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow template delete --kind <kind> --version <version>                     [--db <conn-ref>]
```

## Description

A template is one OSDU kind's JSON schema, bundled so that every `$ref` points into its own `definitions`. Its version is
its content: the first 16 hexadecimal characters of the hash of the canonical schema, so every copy of one content is the
same version. A repository keeps the templates its documents fill as files in its template folders, folders named
`templates`, and a document reads those on its path; `sqlflow check` and every run read the files there, and need no
database for them.

`folders` reads a working copy's template folders from disk, with no database: what a developer runs before committing a
template, or a mapping that names its template's kind alone. `capture` and `import` with `--out` write a template file
into a folder; given the module's database, they also save the template in the library. `list`, `show` and `delete` work
on the library, the saved templates of the module's database, which the Templates page, the explorer and the mapping
builder read, and need the catalog connection (`--db`, else `${env:SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB}`), or `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB` when the
`osdu` schema has a database of its own (see [sqlflow db](db.md)). The GUI's Templates page saves templates through the
control plane instead, into the same table.

Every template saved or written is checked the same way, whatever its source:

- the schema describes the kind asked for (its `x-osdu-schema-source`, when it declares one, is that kind; a schema that
  declares none is given it, so the file says which kind it holds);
- every reference is resolved inside the schema;
- it declares a `data` property, as every OSDU record does.

### folders

Without `--for`, every template folder under `<dir>` (by default the repository's top: the nearest folder holding `.git`
above the current folder, or the current folder), in path order, each file with the template it holds or why it holds
none. A folder named like a template folder but not exactly (`Templates`, or `template` holding `.json` files), and a template folder reached through a link,
are warned of on stderr, since no document reads them.

```text
templates
  templates/osdu_wks_master-data--Wellbore_1.3.0.json  osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0  58d6bdbd9d066a06
welldb/templates
  welldb/templates/osdu_wks_work-product-component--WellLog_1.4.0.json  osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0  26a3c3441882db4f
  welldb/templates/notes.json  holds no template: the schema names no kind. A template file declares the kind it holds in x-osdu-schema-source (...)
```

With `--for <document>`, the template folders that document reads, nearest first, with their files, and the version
each kind they hold settles to for a document that names the kind alone, or why it does not settle. `<dir>`, given, is
the repository's top the walk stops at.

```text
welldb/mappings/WellLog@1.4.0.yaml reads 2 template folder(s), nearest first:
welldb/templates
  welldb/templates/osdu_wks_work-product-component--WellLog_1.4.0.json  osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0  26a3c3441882db4f
templates
  templates/osdu_wks_master-data--Wellbore_1.3.0.json  osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0  58d6bdbd9d066a06
A kind named without a version settles to:
  osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0  58d6bdbd9d066a06  templates/osdu_wks_master-data--Wellbore_1.3.0.json
  osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0  26a3c3441882db4f  welldb/templates/osdu_wks_work-product-component--WellLog_1.4.0.json
```

With `--json`, `folders` prints `{ root, folders: [{ path, files: [{ path, kind, version, problem }] }], warnings }`, and
`folders --for` prints `{ document, looked, folders, kinds: [{ kind, version, file, problem }] }`.

### Where `capture` reads from

`capture` reads the OSDU data definitions, the Open Group's public repository of the OSDU schemas
(`https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/data/data-definitions`), through its GitLab API. A release is a tag of that
repository named `v` and a dotted version; `--release` names one exactly, and without it the newest release is used. The
first time a release is read, its whole `Generated` folder is downloaded as one archive and unpacked into a local copy,
and every later read of that release comes from disk:

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Local copy | `sqlflow/osdu-data-definitions` under the user's temp folder, one folder per release commit. A control plane on the same machine shares it unless `Osdu:SchemaRepository:CacheDirectory` moves its own. A release is read from disk only while every file its download listed in `release-files.json` is there; one a temp cleanup emptied is downloaded again and put back whole. |
| Release list | Kept on disk beside the copy and read again from the repository when it is older than a day. A release name the list does not hold makes it read the list again when the list is over a minute old. When the repository cannot be reached, a list read before is used. |
| Download timeout | 15 minutes per release; 2 minutes per page of the tag list. |
| Repository | Always the public one. The mirror settings (`Osdu:SchemaRepository:ApiUrl`, `WebUrl`) apply to the control plane only. |

The kind's file is the one under `Generated` whose `x-osdu-schema-source` is the kind. It is bundled with every shared
schema it refers to (`../abstract/...`) from the same release. The saved template's origin records the release, the
first 12 characters of its commit and the file:
`OSDU data definitions <release> (<commit>) Generated/<path>`.

### What `import` accepts

- **A bundled file** (every `$ref` already points into its own `definitions`, the form `capture --out` writes) is saved as
  it is, and reads nothing from the network. Its origin is `file <name>`.
- **A file as the data definitions publish it**, which refers to the shared schemas beside it, is bundled with those
  schemas read from `--release` (the newest when left out), exactly as `capture` bundles. Its origin is
  `file <name>, references from OSDU data definitions <release> (<commit>)`. A schema of one's own built on OSDU's shared
  schemas is imported this way.
- **`--from-dir <dir>`** bundles the kind's schema from a local checkout of the data definitions, with no network
  access. `<dir>` is the checkout's `Generated` folder, the one holding the group folders such as `master-data`,
  `work-product-component` and `abstract`; the kind's file is read from `<group>/<Entity>.<version>.json` under it.
  A file not at its expected path is found by its file name anywhere under the folder. Its origin is
  `data definitions under <full path>`.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<subcommand>` | yes | One of `folders`, `capture`, `import`, `list`, `show`, `delete` (case-insensitive). |
| `<dir>` | no | `folders`: the repository's top, the folder scanned or the one a document's walk stops at. |
| `<schema.json>` | `import` without `--from-dir` | The schema file to save. `capture` takes no file and refuses one. |

## Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--for <document>` | path | none | `folders`: the mapping or flow whose template folders to read, and what each kind settles to for it. |
| `--kind <kind>` | OSDU kind | none | Required for `capture`, `import`, `show` and `delete`: `authority:source:entityType:major.minor.patch`, such as `osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0`. |
| `--release <tag>` | release tag | the newest release | `capture`, and `import` of an unbundled file: the release of the data definitions to read. |
| `--out <file.json>` | path | none | `capture`, `import` and `show`: also write the template's bundled schema to this file, a file of a template folder (folders are created). `capture` and `import` write the schema they save, `show` the saved version, as the Templates page downloads it. With `--out`, `capture` and `import` need no database: without one they write the file alone. |
| `--from-dir <dir>` | path | none | `import` only: bundle from a local checkout instead of a file. |
| `--version <version>` | template version | the most recently saved | `show`: the version to lay out. `delete`: required. |
| `--db <conn-ref>` | connection reference | `${env:SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB}` | The catalog database, which holds the `osdu` schema unless `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB` names its own. |
| `--json` | flag | off | Writes JSON instead of text (not for `delete`). |

## Behavior and output

### capture and import

Both print one line: `saved template <kind> version <version>` for a new version, or
`template <kind> version <version> was already saved` when the content is a saved version. With `--json` they print the
template as `{ kind, version, capturedUtc, capturedBy, origin, outcome }`, where `outcome` is `created` or `unchanged`.
With `--out` the file is written before the template is saved, and noted on stderr (`Wrote the bundled schema of template
<kind> version <version> to <path>`), so the file is there even when the save then fails. On a host with no module
database, `--out` writes the file and prints `wrote template <kind> version <version>; it is not saved in the library,
since no module database is configured` (`--json`: `{ kind, version, outcome: "written" }`). The template records who
saved it as `cli:<user>@<machine>`.

### list

Every saved version, by kind and newest first:

```text
osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0  58d6bdbd9d066a06  saved 2026-10-09 07:52:10Z by cli:alex@WS-0142  (OSDU data definitions <release> (<commit>) Generated/master-data/Wellbore.1.3.0.json)
osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0  26a3c3441882db4f  saved 2026-10-09 07:53:44Z by repository sync  (template folder file welldb/templates/osdu_wks_work-product-component--WellLog_1.4.0.json of repository <id>)
```

With none saved it prints `no templates saved yet`. `--json` prints the array of `{ kind, version, capturedUtc,
capturedBy, origin }`.

### show

One version laid out as a template: a header line `<kind> version <version>: <n> variable(s)`, then one line per variable
with its path, its shape and its notes. A shape is the value's type, `list of <type>`, `object`, `list of objects` or
`whole <type>`. The notes say `required` when the schema requires it, `written by OSDU Delivery` (the record id and kind)
or `set by OSDU` (what OSDU sets when it stores the record) for a variable no mapping fills, `points to <entity types>`
for a reference, and `unit <context>` for a value with a unit. With `--json` each variable is
`{ path, shape, type, itemType, required, role, relationships, unitContext, description }`, where `role` is `Mapping`,
`Engine` or `Osdu`.

With `--out <file.json>`, `show` also writes the saved version to the file, before it lays the version out, and notes
`Wrote the bundled schema of template <kind> version <version> to <path>` on stderr, so stdout and `--json` are as without
it. The file is the bundled schema, indented, with its keys in the order the schema was written: what the Templates page
downloads, and what `capture --out` writes. Importing it saves nothing new
([a template as a file](../concepts/templates.md#a-template-as-a-file)). A version saved before a template named its kind
is written as saved, with a note that no template folder reads it, and how to write it naming its kind.

### delete

Deletes one version from the library and prints `deleted template <kind> version <version>`. A version a repository's
template folder holds, or a synced mapping fills, is refused, naming up to 20 of the files or mappings: remove the files
from the repository, or move the mappings to another version, and sync first.

### Errors

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `Kind '<kind>' must be 'authority:source:entityType:major.minor.patch'.` | `capture` or `import` with a `--kind` that is not an OSDU kind. |
| `'sqlflow template capture' takes no flow: it saves the kind's schema from the OSDU data definitions.` | A file was given to `capture`. |
| `--for names '<path>', which is not a file; name the mapping or flow whose template folders to read.` | `folders --for` with a path that is not a file. |
| `Saved templates live in the module's database. Run 'sqlflow template' with --db <conn-ref>, or set the catalog variable; 'sqlflow template folders' reads a repository's template folders without one.` | `list`, `show`, `delete`, or `capture` or `import` without `--out`, on a host with no module database. |
| `The OSDU data definitions have no release '<tag>'; the latest is <tag>.` | `--release` names no release tag. |
| `The OSDU data definitions have no Generated/<path> at <release>.` | The release publishes no schema for the kind. |
| `The OSDU data definitions at <url> could not be reached for <what>: <cause>` | No network path to the repository. Use `import --from-dir` or a bundled file instead. |
| `<where>: the schema describes '<other kind>', not '<kind>'.` | The file is another kind's schema. |
| `<where>: the schema refers to '<ref>' outside itself. A template is saved from a bundled schema, where every reference is resolved into its definitions.` | A reference was left unresolved. |
| `<where>: the schema declares no 'data' property, so it does not describe an OSDU record.` | The file is not a record schema (an abstract building block, for example). |
| `The data definitions folder '<dir>' does not exist.` / `No schema file '<path>' under '<dir>'.` | `--from-dir` names the wrong folder. |
| `There is no saved template for '<kind>'.` / `There is no template <kind> version <version>.` | `show` or `delete` of something not saved. |
| `The bundled schema of template <kind> version <version> could not be written to '<path>': <reason>` | `--out` names a file that cannot be written: a folder on the way is a file, the disk is full, or the account may not write there. |
| `The template <kind> version <version> is held by the template folder file(s) <files> of a synced repository, so it cannot be deleted. Remove the file from the repository and sync it first.` | `delete` of a version a repository's folder holds. |
| `The template <kind> version <version> is pinned by mapping(s) <list>, so it cannot be deleted. Move those mappings to another template version first.` | `delete` of a version a synced mapping fills. |

Each is printed as `ERROR  <message>` on stderr; a missing `--kind`, file or `--version` is a usage error followed by the
verb's usage lines.

## Examples

Write the schema a WellLog mapping fills into the template folder beside its project, from the newest release, in a
working copy with no database:

```bash
sqlflow template capture --kind osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0 --out welldb/templates/osdu_wks_work-product-component--WellLog_1.4.0.json
```

```text
wrote template osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0 version <16 hexadecimal characters>; it is not saved in the library, since no module database is configured
```

See what the mapping now reads, before committing:

```bash
sqlflow template folders --for welldb/mappings/WellLog@1.4.0.yaml
```

Bundle a template of one's own, built on OSDU's shared schemas, into the folder:

```bash
sqlflow template import drafts/Facility.1.0.0.json --kind acme:wks:master-data--Facility:1.0.0 --out welldb/templates/acme_wks_master-data--Facility_1.0.0.json
```

Write the saved versions an estate's mappings pinned before template folders into its repository, from its database:

```bash
sqlflow template show --kind osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0 --version 58d6bdbd9d066a06 --out templates/osdu_wks_master-data--Wellbore_1.3.0.json --db '${env:SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB}'
```

Bundle from a local checkout of the data definitions, and remove a version nothing holds or fills any more:

```bash
sqlflow template import --from-dir ~/src/data-definitions/Generated --kind osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0 --out templates/osdu_wks_master-data--Wellbore_1.3.0.json
sqlflow template delete --kind osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0 --version 58d6bdbd9d066a06
```

## Exit behavior

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The subcommand did what it was asked, including a save of a version that was already saved, and a `folders` listing that found files holding no template (those are listed). |
| 1 | A usage error or a refusal from the table above, printed as `ERROR  <message>`, or a database connection that could not be resolved. |
| 130 | Interrupted with Ctrl+C. |
