# sqlflow partition

OSDU Delivery's command line is `sqlflow`: SQLFlow's CLI with the OSDU verbs added. `partition` is one of those verbs.
It keeps the partition registry: the list of OSDU data partitions (`dev`, `test`, ...) that a flow naming no partitions
serves, and the one marked default, which a run that names no partition runs in. Registering a partition is how a new
environment is added without changing any flow document.

## Synopsis

```bash
sqlflow partition list                                          [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow partition add <name> [--description <text>] [--default] [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow partition describe <name> --description <text>          [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow partition default <name>                                [--db <conn-ref>] [--json]
sqlflow partition remove <name>                                 [--db <conn-ref>]
```

## Description

The registry is the table `[osdu].[Partition]` in the module's database: one row per partition, with what it is for, who
registered it and when, and a flag for the one default. The verb works on the database directly, not through the control
plane, so it needs the catalog connection (`--db`, else `${env:SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB}`), or `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB` when the
`osdu` schema has a database of its own (see [sqlflow db](db.md)).

What the registry decides, and what it does not:

- **A registry-driven flow serves every registered partition.** A delivery, cache, assertion, dimension or inventory
  flow that names neither `partitions` nor a `data-partition-id` header serves the partitions registered now, and a run
  of it has to name one of them (or take the default).
- **A run that names no partition runs in the default**, when the flow serves it; for a flow that names exactly one
  partition, that one.
- **A hard-coded partition need not be registered.** A flow that lists its partitions under `partitions`, or names one in
  its `data-partition-id` header, works in them whether or not they are registered.

The full model (binding a run to a partition, per-partition ledgers and caches, the `*` value of a cache refresh) is in
[Partitions](../concepts/partitions.md).

Rules the registry keeps:

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Names | A partition is named by its data-partition-id, written literally: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen and dot, at most 200 characters. A `${env:...}` or `${keyvault:...}` reference is refused, because the name is the key the partition's cache, ledgers and runs are kept under. |
| Case | Names compare regardless of case: `Dev` and `dev` are one partition. |
| One default | At most one partition is the default, which a filtered unique index enforces. The first partition registered becomes the default. |
| Removal | Removing a partition deletes nothing kept under it: its caches, ledgers and runs stay. The default can be removed only when it is the last partition, so a registry that holds partitions always has a default. |
| Description | At most 400 characters. |

A run reads the registry when it starts. The rows a repository sync writes per partition (a registry-driven flow's
interfaces and cache types, which the GUI and the API read) follow the registry at each sync. After a change here, run
`sqlflow db sync` or press Sync now on the Repositories page; the control plane's own Partitions page and API make every
repository due at once instead.

When the registry was added, the migration registered every partition the catalog already kept data under (every
cache's partition and every partition a delivery interface was described in) and made it the default when there was
exactly one.

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<subcommand>` | yes | One of `list`, `add`, `describe`, `default`, `remove` (case-insensitive). |
| `<name>` | all but `list` | The partition, by its data-partition-id, as runs name it. |

## Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--description <text>` | string | none | `add`: what the partition is for. `describe`: required; the new text, and an empty value (`--description ""`) clears it. |
| `--default` | flag | off | `add` only: make the new partition the default, taking the mark from the one that had it. |
| `--db <conn-ref>` | connection reference | `${env:SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB}` | The catalog database, which holds the `osdu` schema unless `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB` names its own. |
| `--json` | flag | off | Writes the partition (or for `list`, the array) as JSON instead of text. `remove` prints text either way. |

## Behavior and output

### list

Every registered partition, ordered by name:

```text
dev  (default)  Development platform  [registered by cli:ops@build-agent at 2026-10-09 07:30:11Z]
test  Acceptance testing platform  [registered by cli:ops@build-agent at 2026-10-09 07:31:40Z]
```

With an empty registry it prints
`no partition is registered; a flow that names no partitions has none to run in. Register one with 'sqlflow partition add <name>'.`
With `--json` each partition is `{ name, description, isDefault, createdUtc, createdBy, updatedUtc, updatedBy }`.

This lists the registry only. The GUI's Partitions page and `GET /api/v1/delivery/partitions` also list the partitions
something is still kept under (a cache, a flow that hard-codes one, a ledger) after it was removed, marked unregistered,
with what each holds.

### add

Registers the partition and prints `<name> registered`, or `<name> registered, and is the default` when it took the
default (with `--default`, or because it is the first). A second line reminds that each repository describes its
registry-driven flows in the registered partitions at its next sync.

### describe

Sets what the partition is for and prints `<name> described`.

### default

Makes the partition the default and prints `<name> is the default`. The partition that had the mark loses it in the same
transaction.

### remove

Takes the partition out of the registry and prints
`<name> removed; its caches, ledgers and runs stay, and no registry-driven flow runs in it until it is registered again`,
followed by the sync reminder. A partition that was not registered prints `<name> was not registered` and exits 0.
After removal, the partition's records stay readable (`sqlflow records ... --partition <name>` and the GUI read them
when the partition is named), and a run of a registry-driven flow in it is refused until it is registered again. A flow
that hard-codes the partition is not affected.

The command records `cli:<user>@<machine>` (the account it runs as, on that machine) as who registered or changed a
partition; the Partitions page and the API record the signed-in
user. Registering, describing, changing the default and removing are admin actions there.

### Errors

| Message | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `Partition '<name>' is registered already.` | `add` of a name the registry holds, in any case. |
| `The partition is the reference '<value>'. A partition is named literally, by its data-partition-id: ...` | `add` of a `${env:...}` or `${keyvault:...}` reference. |
| `The partition '<value>' is not a data-partition-id: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen and dot, at most 200 characters.` | `add` of a name with other characters, or a longer one. |
| `A partition's description is at most 400 characters; this one is <n>.` | `--description` too long. |
| `Partition '<name>' is not registered with the catalog, so nothing runs in it. Register it on the Partitions page or with 'sqlflow partition add <name>'; the registered partitions are <list>.` | `describe` or `default` of a partition the registry does not hold. |
| `Partition '<name>' is the default, which a run that names no partition runs in; make another partition the default before removing it.` | `remove` of the default while other partitions are registered. |
| `The partition registry changed while this change was made (<cause>); nothing was changed. Try again.` | Two changes at the same moment (two registrations of one name, or two changes of the default); the database refused the second. |
| `name the partition to register: its data-partition-id, as runs name it.` | `add` without a name; the verb's usage follows. Each other subcommand has its own line of this kind. |
| `give what the partition is for with --description <text>; an empty one clears it.` | `describe` without `--description`. |
| `use 'partition list', 'partition add <name> [--description <text>] [--default]', ...` | No subcommand, or one that is not listed; the verb's usage follows. |

Each is printed as `ERROR  <message>` on stderr.

## Examples

Register the two environments of an estate, with `dev` the default:

```bash
sqlflow partition add dev --description "Development platform"
sqlflow partition add test --description "Acceptance testing platform"
sqlflow db sync ./welldb --repo welldb
```

```text
dev registered, and is the default
each repository describes its registry-driven flows in the registered partitions at its next sync ('sqlflow db sync', or Sync now on the Repositories page)
test registered
each repository describes its registry-driven flows in the registered partitions at its next sync ('sqlflow db sync', or Sync now on the Repositories page)
```

Move the default to `test`, then retire `dev` without losing what was delivered there:

```bash
sqlflow partition default test
sqlflow partition remove dev
```

Read the registry from a script:

```bash
sqlflow partition list --json --db '${env:SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB}'
```

## Exit behavior

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The subcommand did what it was asked, including `remove` of a partition that was not registered. |
| 1 | A usage error or a refusal from the table above, printed as `ERROR  <message>`, or a database connection that could not be resolved. |
| 130 | Interrupted with Ctrl+C. |
