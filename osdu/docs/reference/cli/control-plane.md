# Control-plane verbs in OSDU Delivery

OSDU Delivery's command line is `sqlflow`: SQLFlow's CLI with the OSDU verbs added. The control-plane verbs (`login`,
`trigger`, `runs`, `groups`, `schedules`, `repos`, `pipelines`, `search`, `datasources`, `nodes`, `health`, `doctor`)
are SQLFlow's, and signing in, the credential order, every subcommand and its output are documented in
[Control-plane verbs](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/cli/control-plane.md). OSDU Delivery's control plane
(`osdu/hosts/SqlFlow.Delivery.ControlPlane.Host`) is SQLFlow's control plane with the OSDU module composed in, so these
verbs work against it unchanged. This page covers what is different when they are pointed at OSDU flows.

## Two kinds of verbs in one binary

| Verbs | Talk to | Need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQLFlow's control-plane verbs (`trigger`, `runs`, `schedules`, ...) | The control plane's `/api/v1` | `--url` or `SQLFLOW_URL`, and a token (`sqlflow login`, `--token` or `SQLFLOW_TOKEN`). |
| The OSDU verbs (`check`, `preview`, `values`, `records`, `config`, `partition`, `cache`, `template`, `assertions`, `dimensions`, `inventory`) | The module's database directly | `--db` or `SQLFLOW_CATALOG_DB` (and `SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB` when the `osdu` schema has a database of its own). None of them calls the control plane. |

So a terminal that can reach the control plane but not the database can trigger and follow OSDU runs, but cannot read a
ledger with `sqlflow records`; it reads records through the GUI or the delivery API instead
([The delivery API](../concepts/api.md)).

## Triggering an OSDU run

`trigger` takes the kind arguments of the flow, the same three a local `sqlflow run` takes, and sends them with the run:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--operation <name>` | Which of the kind's operations the run performs (`deliver`, `plan`, `verify`, ... for a delivery flow; `refresh` for a cache flow). Omitted takes the kind's default. |
| `--set name=value` | A run value, repeatable: a flow parameter, or `partition`, which names the OSDU partition the run targets. |
| `--payload <json>` or `--payload @<file>` | One JSON object whose shape the flow kind owns. |

```bash
# plan one log source in the test partition, change nothing, and follow the trace
sqlflow trigger --repo welldb --flow welldb-welllog-03-delivery --operation plan \
  --set partition=test --set logSource=WIRELINE --follow

# deliver it
sqlflow trigger --repo welldb --flow welldb-welllog-03-delivery --set partition=test --set logSource=WIRELINE

# refresh the lookup cache of every partition the cache flow serves, one after another
sqlflow trigger --repo welldb --flow welldb-lookups-00-cache --set 'partition=*'
```

What each operation does and what a delivery payload carries is in [Running an OSDU flow](run.md); how a run settles
its partition is in [Partitions](../concepts/partitions.md). The partition is taken off the run's values before the
flow's parameters are read, so it never moves a watermark or a submission's scope.

The control plane attaches the central configuration to every delivery, cache, retrieval, assertion and dimension run it
queues, from a trigger, a schedule or a run group alike, so the node resolves `${env:NAME}` from it first
([sqlflow config](config.md)). A local `sqlflow run` gets none of it.

## Schedules

`schedules create` carries `--operation` and `--set` values into every fire of the schedule, so an operation or a
partition is part of the schedule rather than something to remember:

```bash
# the hourly delivery to test, and a nightly verify of the same flow as a schedule of its own
sqlflow schedules create --repo welldb --flow welldb-welllog-03-delivery --cron "0 * * * *" \
  --set partition=test --set logSource=WIRELINE
sqlflow schedules create --repo welldb --flow welldb-welllog-03-delivery --cron "0 3 * * *" \
  --operation verify --set partition=test --set logSource=WIRELINE
```

A flow's YAML `schedule:` block takes the same as `operation:` and `values:`.

## Following runs

```bash
sqlflow runs list --kind delivery --status failed
sqlflow runs show <runId> --json
sqlflow runs trace <runId> --follow
sqlflow pipelines list --repo welldb --kind cache
```

- `--kind` filters by flow kind. The kinds OSDU Delivery adds are `delivery`, `retrieval`, `cache`, `assertion`,
  `dimension` and `inventory`, beside the `pre` and `ing` flows that feed them.
- `runs show` prints SQLFlow's run header. The kind's own part of a run is in the `--json` form: `operation`,
  `requestedBy`, `values`, `payload` (including the central configuration the control plane attached, as `references` and
  `partitionReferences`) and `resultJson`, the result the kind recorded (for a delivery run, what it planned and
  delivered; see [Running an OSDU flow](run.md)). What happened to each record is in the ledger:
  [sqlflow records](records.md).

## Compute tasks of the module

A value check of a mapping across a scope and a removal of records from OSDU are queued as compute tasks, drained by the
nodes. They appear in SQLFlow's task listing under their operation names:

```bash
sqlflow datasources tasks --operation delivery-check-values
sqlflow datasources tasks --operation delivery-delete
sqlflow datasources task <id>
```

## Search

`sqlflow search` prints SQLFlow's categories (objects, columns, definitions, files, flows, flow columns, executed SQL).
The control plane's combined search (`GET /api/v1/search/all`, the GUI's search box) also answers a `records` category from
the ledger, but the CLI does not print it, with or without `--json`. To find a record from a terminal, use
`sqlflow records list <flow.yaml> --search <term>` or `sqlflow records show <flow.yaml> --key <key>`, which read the
ledger directly ([sqlflow records](records.md)).

## Health

The readiness probe of an OSDU Delivery control plane includes a `module-databases` check beside the catalog's. It stays
unhealthy until the control plane has verified the `osdu` module database against its build, and holds the refusal when
the database is missing, behind or ahead (the control plane then stops, logging
`The control plane refuses to run: <reason>`). So `sqlflow health` reporting a failing `ready` under a passing `live`
can mean the module database rather than the catalog. The probe's body says only `Unhealthy`; the control plane's log
names the reason, and `sqlflow db status` says what to apply ([sqlflow db](db.md)).
