# Assertion flow (flowType: assertion): data quality tests of what an OSDU partition holds

A `flowType: assertion` document holds tests of what an OSDU partition holds once your data has landed: that search
finds the records, that their values are the ones meant, that their references resolve, that they meet their schema,
that their legal tags are valid, that every record a delivery flow says it delivered is there, and that their bulk data
is in the Wellbore DDMS. Each test reads one OSDU kind in one version and holds what it reads to its assertions. Each run
keeps a report in the module's database, which the GUI, the API and `sqlflow assertions` read.

Use it after a [delivery flow](delivery.md), to check what users of OSDU see rather than what the delivery sent. A test
only reads: nothing is ever written to OSDU. SQLFlow's own `assertions:` on an `ing` flow
([data quality assertions](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/flow/ing-quality.md)) check a SQL table; an assertion flow
checks OSDU.

## Example

The estate's well log tests, `flows/welldb-welllog-04-assertion.yaml`:

```yaml
flowType: assertion
name: welldb-welllog-04-assertion
batch: welldb
description: What the well logs of the well database look like in OSDU once they are delivered.

      body:
        scope: ${env:OSDU_SCOPE}
  ddmsRoot: /api/os-wellbore-ddms

defaults:
  maxRecords: 10000
  examples: 20

failRunOn: error

reliability:
  concurrency: 4
  retry: { attempts: 4, backoff: exponential, baseDelayMs: 500, maxDelayMs: 30000 }

    tags: [bulk]
    kind: osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0
    query: 'data.Source:"{system}"'
    maxRecords: 200
    sample: true
    bulk: { columns: [MD], maxRows: 2000000 }
    assert:
      - rowCount: { atLeast: 1 }
      - columns: { includes: [MD] }
      - column: MD
        monotonic: strictlyIncreasing
      - column: MD

  - name: log-names
    description: No delivered log is filed under a placeholder name.
    tags: [coverage]
    kind: osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.4.0
    query: 'data.Source:"{system}"'
    assert:
      - groupBy: data.Name
        absent: [UNKNOWN]
        groupCount: { atLeast: 1 }
```

`sqlflow validate` prints `OK  'welldb-welllog-04-assertion' is valid (assertion: ${env:OSDU_URL} -> report).`
The queries find the records by `data.Source`, which assumes the mappings write `Source: welldb` under `data`; narrow
by whatever your records carry. [Testing what OSDU holds](../guides/data-quality-tests.md) builds a flow like this step
by step.

## Keys reference

The document is read strictly: an unknown key fails validation naming it.

| Key | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `flowType` | string | yes | none | `assertion`. |
| `name` | string | yes | none | The flow's name: its pipeline identity, and the name its reports are kept under (`name@partition` for a flow that tests partitions). |
| `batch`, `description` | string | no | none | The SQLFlow batch, and free text. |
| `partitions` | list | no | none | The partitions the flow tests, 1 to 64, each once (see [Which partition a run tests](#which-partition-a-run-tests)). |
| `parameters` | map | no | none | Named parameters (`required`, `default`, `description`), used as `{name}` tokens in queries, ids and the text a test compares with. `partition` is reserved: `{partition}` is always the partition the run tests. |
| `source` | map | yes | none | The platform and where its services are. |
| `defaults` | map | no | see below | What a test takes when it says nothing itself. |
| `failRunOn` | string | no | `error` | Which outcomes fail the platform run: `error`, `warning` or `never` (see [Outcomes](#outcomes)). |
| `tests` | list | yes | none | The tests, 1 to 500. |
| `reliability` | map | no | defaults | The HTTP settings, as on a [delivery flow](delivery.md), and `concurrency`: how many tests run at once, and how many requests one test has in flight (default 8, at least 1). `parallelInterfaces` is refused. |
| `schedule`, `mode`, `lifecycle` | | no | none | SQLFlow's envelope keys: see [schedule](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/flow/schedule.md). |

### source

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | required | The platform's base URL, usually `${env:OSDU_URL}`: the one the delivery flows deliver to. |
| `auth` | `type: none` | Written as `target.auth` on a delivery flow. Secrets are references only (`${env:NAME}`, `${keyvault:NAME}`): a literal is refused when the flow is read. |
| `headers` | none | Headers sent with every request; `data-partition-id` only for a flow tested in one fixed partition. A header that carries a credential holds a reference; a literal is refused when the flow is read. |
| `queryPath` | `/api/search/v2/query` | The search that counts, groups and finds index errors. |
| `searchPath` | `/api/search/v2/query_with_cursor` | The cursor search records are paged through. |
| `recordQueryPath` | `/api/storage/v2/query/records` | Storage's read of records and references by id, 100 at a time. |
| `legalPath` | `/api/legal/v1` | The legal service, under which `/legaltags:validate` is asked (25 names a request). |
| `ddmsRoot` | `/api/os-wellbore-ddms` | Where the Wellbore DDMS is, for tests that read bulk data. |

A path starts with `/` and has no whitespace, query or fragment.

### defaults

| Key | Default | Range | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `maxRecords` | 10000 | 1 to 1,000,000 | The most records a test reads. |
| `examples` | 20 | 1 to 500 | The most failing records an assertion names. Counts are always exact. |
| `read` | `storage` | `storage`, `index` | Where a test reads its records. |
| `indexSettleSeconds` | 300 | 0 to 3600 | How long the index is given to list a change (see [Records the index may not list yet](#records-the-index-may-not-list-yet)). |

## Which partition a run tests

A run tests one partition and keeps its report under it. A flow says which partitions it tests in one of three ways:

| The flow | A run tests |
| --- | --- |
| `partitions: [dev, test]` | The partition the run names (`--set partition=test`, a schedule's `values: { partition: test }`, the GUI's title bar), which has to be one of them. With none named: the registry's default partition if the flow names it, else the flow's only partition. |
| Neither `partitions` nor a `data-partition-id` header | Any partition registered with the catalog: the one the run names, or the registry's default. |
| `source.headers: { data-partition-id: dev }` | That partition, always. A run that names a partition is refused. |

Partitions are written literally, never as references; `*` is not a partition, and a run asking for `*` is refused
(`Assertion flow '<name>' tests one partition per run, since a report describes one partition; name the partition to test instead of '*'.`).
A flow that names its partitions may not also name the header. A test's own `partitions` narrows it to some of the
flow's partitions; a run in another records it as `skipped`. See [Partitions](../concepts/partitions.md).

## Tests

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | required | Unique in the flow, ignoring case: a letter or digit followed by letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, at most 100 characters. Runs and reports name tests by it. |
| `description` | none | What the test checks, shown on the board and in reports. |
| `tags` | none | Up to 20 labels, written as names are. A run can select tests by tag. |
| `partitions` | all | The flow's partitions the test runs in. |
| `kind` | required | The one type the test reads, in one version: `authority:source:entityType:major.minor.patch`, as the delivering mapping's `template.kind` names it. Wildcards are refused. |
| `template` | newest | The saved template version its fields are checked against: the mapping's `template.version`. Left out, the most recently captured template of the kind. |
| `query` | none | A Lucene query narrowing the kind, with `{parameter}` and `{partition}` tokens. Left out, every record of the kind. |
| `ids` | none | 1 to 1,000 record ids to read from storage instead of searching, with tokens. Not with `query`, `spatial` or `sort`. |
| `spatial` | none | The search's `spatialFilter`: a geo `field` and exactly one of `byBoundingBox` (`topLeft`, `bottomRight`), `byDistance` (`point`, `distance` in metres), `byGeoPolygon` (`points`), `byIntersection` (`polygons`, each with `points`), `byWithinPolygon` (`points`); a point is `{ latitude, longitude }`. |
| `sort` | none | 1 to 5 `{ field, order: asc or desc }`: the order the search returns records in. |
| `read` | `defaults.read` | `storage`: each record as storage holds it, read by the ids the search finds. `index`: the search hits themselves, only what the index holds. |
| `maxRecords` | `defaults.maxRecords` | The most records the test reads; a test naming more ids than this is refused. |
| `sample` | `false` | When more records match than `maxRecords`: `false` evaluates no assertion over the records and says so; `true` evaluates the first `maxRecords` and marks the result as a sample. |
| `indexSettleSeconds` | `defaults.indexSettleSeconds` | This test's settle window. |
| `severity` | `error` | The severity of its assertions that state none: `error`, `warning` or `info`. |
| `bulk` | none | Read each record's bulk data: `columns` (the columns read; they include every column the assertions name) and `maxRows` (default 1,000,000, at most 100,000,000). See [Bulk data](#bulk-data). |
| `assert` | required | The assertions, 1 to 100. |

A test first counts what its query matches (`POST /api/search/v2/query` with `trackTotalCount`), or reads its ids from
storage. Assertions that the search answers on its own (`count`, `groupBy`, `indexed`) read no record. When an assertion
needs the records, the test pages through them with a cursor and, reading `storage`, reads each page's ids back 100 at a
time; every record is handed to every assertion once, so memory holds a page, not the partition. A record the index
lists and storage does not return is left out and noted. An id storage does not hold, or a record of another kind than
the test's, is left out and noted too.

```yaml
  - name: wellbores-in-area
    kind: osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0
    spatial:
      field: data.SpatialLocation.Wgs84Coordinates
      byBoundingBox:
        topLeft: { latitude: 31.0, longitude: -98.0 }
        bottomRight: { latitude: 29.0, longitude: -94.0 }
    assert:
      - count: { atLeast: 1, atMost: 5000 }

  - name: named-wellbores
    kind: osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0
    ids:
      - "{partition}:master-data--Wellbore:1001"
      - "{partition}:master-data--Wellbore:1002"
    assert:
      - count: 2
      - field: data.FacilityName
        matches: '^[A-Z0-9 /-]+$'
```

## Assertions

An assertion has exactly one subject, the keys that subject takes, and optionally `name` (what reports call it, at most
200 characters; left out, a label read off what it asserts), `description` and `severity`. A key its subject does not
take fails validation: `<test>: assert[<n>] is a <subject> assertion, which does not take <keys>.`

| Subject | Takes | Holds when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `count: <n or comparison>` | | The number of records the test matches (the index's exact count, or for `ids` the records storage returns of the kind) compares true. |
| `field: <path>` | one condition, `for`, `values`, `optional`, `where`, `ignoreCase`, `tolerance` | The condition holds of the path's values in the records read, for the share `for` asks. |
| `aggregate: min, max, sum, avg, count, distinct, missing` | `field` (or `column`), comparison keys, `tolerance` | The aggregate of the field over every record read (or of the column over each record's rows, record by record) compares true. |
| `unique: [paths]` | | No two records read share the values of all the paths (1 to 20). Records holding none of them are passed over. |
| `groupBy: <path>` | `groups`, `mode`, `absent`, `groupCount` | The search's groups of the path's values (`aggregateBy`): each group under `groups` has a count that compares true (`mode: exact` allows no other group; `includes`, the default, does), no group under `absent` is there, and the number of groups compares true with `groupCount`. Reads no record. Not with `ids`. |
| `recordSet: { columns, rows, mode }` | | The records projected onto `columns` (1 to 20 paths) match `rows` (at most 1,000): `exact` (the same rows in any order, the default), `ordered` (in the test's `sort` order), `includes` or `excludes`. |
| `conforms: true` | | Every record read meets the schema of its kind as the template states it (required properties, types, formats, patterns, enumerations), and is of the test's kind. Needs `read: storage`. |
| `indexed: true` | | No record the test matches has an index status of 201 or above (`index.statusCode:[201 TO *]`): the indexer mapped every record whole. Not with `ids`. |
| `legal: valid` | | Every record read carries a legal tag, and every tag is valid now, as Legal's `POST /legaltags:validate` answers. |
| `delivered: <delivery flow>` | `interface`, `exact` | Every record that flow's ledger holds as delivered in the partition is among what the test matches; with `exact: true`, nothing else is. |
| `rowCount: <n or comparison>` | | Each record's bulk data has that many rows. |
| `columns: { includes, excludes, equals }` | | Each record's bulk data has these columns, lacks those, or has exactly these (in any order). |
| `column: <name>` | one condition, `for`, `optional`, `where`, `ignoreCase`, `tolerance` | The condition holds of the column's values in each record's bulk data, for the share of its rows `for` asks. |
| `monotonic: increasing, decreasing, strictlyIncreasing, strictlyDecreasing` | `column` | The column's values only go that way, row after row, in each record's bulk data. Absent values are passed over. |

An assertion with no subject fails with `names no subject; an assertion is one of count, field, column, aggregate, unique, groupBy, recordSet, conforms, indexed, legal, delivered, rowCount, columns or monotonic.`;
one with two fails with `names <a> and <b>; an assertion has one subject. Write one assertion for each.`

When there is nothing to check (no record matched, or none had a value), `field`, `column`, `resolves`, `unique`,
`conforms`, `legal` and the bulk assertions fail, except a `field` or `column` assertion with `for: none`. An `aggregate`
compares what it found (`count`, `distinct` and `missing` come to 0; `sum`, `avg`, `min` and `max` fail with no number),
and so do `recordSet` (an `exact` set with no rows asserts that no record matches) and `delivered`.

`delivered` reads the ledger of the delivery flow named (ignoring case) in the run's partition. A flow delivering several
interfaces needs `interface`. It cannot be judged on a sample, and errors when the ledger holds more delivered records
than the test's `maxRecords`.

### Comparisons of numbers: count, rowCount, groupCount, groups, length

These take a whole number (equals) or a mapping of `equals`, `notEquals`, `atLeast`, `atMost`, `greaterThan`,
`lessThan` and `between: [low, high]`, every one of which has to hold: `count: { atLeast: 1, atMost: 5000 }`. An
`aggregate` takes the same keys beside it (`aggregate: avg`, `field: ...`, `between: [0.1, 0.2]`); `min` and `max`
compare numbers or ISO 8601 dates, the others numbers.

### Conditions

A `field` or `column` assertion, and each `where` condition, takes exactly one of these operators:

| Operator | Operand | A value meets it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `equals`, `notEquals` | a value | It equals (or does not equal) the operand. |
| `in`, `notIn` | 1 to 1,000 values | It equals one of them (or none). |
| `atLeast`, `atMost`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan` | a number or text | It orders that way against the operand. |
| `between` | `[low, high]` | It lies between them, both included; both numbers, or both text (dates compare as instants), low first. |
| `matches`, `notMatches` | a .NET regular expression | Its text matches (or does not). One second at most per value; no tokens are substituted. |
| `startsWith`, `endsWith` | text | It is text starting (or ending) with it. |
| `contains`, `notContains` | a value | It is a list holding a value equal to the operand, or text containing it. |
| `exists` | `true` or `false` | The record (or row) has a value there at all, or has none. |
| `empty` | `true` or `false` | It is empty (null, empty text, an empty list or object), or not. |
| `type` | `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, `null` | It is of that JSON type; `integer` is a number without a fraction. |
| `length` | a number or a comparison | Its text length, or its list's item count, compares true. |
| `resolves` | `true`, or an entity type such as `master-data--Wellbore` | It is a record id (`partition:entity-type:id`, with or without a version) storage holds, of that entity type when one is named. Fields only, and not in `where`. |

How values compare:

- A number compares as a number, exactly as written unless `tolerance` is given, when it may be that far off. Text
  holding a number equals that number, and text `true` or `false` that boolean, since OSDU keeps some values as text.
- Text compares ordinally, or ignoring case with `ignoreCase: true`. Two ISO 8601 dates compare as the instants they
  name, so `greaterThan: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"` orders dates.
- A list or an object never equals a single value: test each item with `[*]`, or use `contains`.
- `ignoreCase` applies to `equals`, `notEquals`, `in`, `notIn`, `matches`, `notMatches`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`,
  `contains` and `notContains`; `tolerance` to the equalities, `in`, `notIn`, the orderings and `between`, against a
  number.
- `{parameter}` and `{partition}` tokens are substituted in the text a condition compares with, in `recordSet` rows and
  in group names, never in a regular expression. A `recordSet` compares values exactly as JSON: `5` and `"5"` differ there.

What decides a record:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `for` | `all` | The share of records (rows, for a column) the condition has to hold for: `all`, `any`, `none`, or a percentage such as `99%`. `all`, `any` and a percentage fail when nothing was checked. |
| `values` | `all` | For a path yielding several values in one record: `all` holds the record when every value meets the condition, `any` when one does. Fields only. |
| `optional` | `false` | `true` passes over a record (or row) with no value at all, instead of failing it. |
| `where` | none | 1 to 10 conditions, each with its own `field` (or `column`) and operator, selecting the records (or rows) looked at: all of them have to hold, and one holds when one of its values meets it. |

`resolves` takes no `for` or `values`: every reference the records carry is looked up (100 a request, at most 200,000
distinct references per assertion).

```yaml
      - field: data.TopMeasuredDepth
        atLeast: 0
        where:
          - field: data.ReferenceCurveID
            equals: MD
      - field: data.Curves.Mnemonic
        equals: gr
        ignoreCase: true
        values: any
        for: 95%
      - field: data.Name
        equals: UNKNOWN
        for: none
      - aggregate: max
        field: modifyTime
        atLeast: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
```

### Paths

A path is dotted from the record's root, which is one of `id`, `kind`, `version`, `acl`, `legal`, `data`, `tags`,
`ancestry`, `meta`, `createTime`, `createUser`, `modifyTime` and `modifyUser`. Arrays are crossed implicitly
(`data.Curves.Mnemonic` is every curve's mnemonic), or with `[*]` or `[n]`. A null is no value.

## Bulk data

A test with `bulk` reads each record's bulk data from the Wellbore DDMS
(`GET {ddmsRoot}/ddms/v3/{collection}/{id}/data`, first `?describe=true` for its columns and rows, then the rows a page
at a time in JSON). Only kinds the DDMS keeps bulk data for take it:

| Entity type | Collection |
| --- | --- |
| `work-product-component--WellLog` | `welllogs` |
| `work-product-component--WellboreTrajectory` | `wellboretrajectories` |
| `work-product-component--PPFGDataset` | `ppfgdataset` |
| `work-product-component--WellPressureTestRawMeasurement` | `wellpressuretestrawmeasurement` |

`rowCount`, `columns`, `column`, a column `aggregate` and `monotonic` need it. Each record's bulk data is held to each
assertion on its own, records in parallel up to `reliability.concurrency`, and the assertion holds when every record's
does. A record the DDMS holds no bulk data for (it answers 404) fails, so does one lacking a column an assertion names,
and so does one the DDMS answers a page of without a column the read asked for:
`the DDMS answered the page of its bulk data from row <n> without the column <c>, which the read asked for and its description lists`.
One holding more rows than `bulk.maxRows` fails the assertions that read its rows, unless the test sets `sample: true`,
which reads the first `maxRows` rows.
`NaN` and infinite values read as no value.

`bulk.columns` (no commas, at most 256 characters each) is the columns read. Left out, the read takes exactly the
columns the assertions name: a `column` assertion's own column and its `where` columns, a column `aggregate`'s, a
`monotonic`'s. Listed, only those are read, so the list must include every one of them; a list that leaves one out is
refused when the flow loads. The example's `log-curves` test, given a fifth assertion `column: GR` while its
`bulk.columns` stays `[MD]`:

```text
<file>: tests[2] 'log-curves': bulk.columns lists the only columns the test reads, and leaves out 'GR' (assert[4]); add it to bulk.columns, or leave bulk.columns out to read exactly the columns the assertions name.
```

Other DDMSs, and the files behind dataset records, are not read by a test; their storage records are tested like any
other record.

## Checked against the template

Before a test that reads fields (a field condition, a field aggregate, `unique`, `groupBy`, `recordSet`, `conforms`, a
`sort` or a `spatial` filter) reads anything, it is checked against the template of its kind (see
[Templates](../concepts/templates.md)): every path has to be a property of the schema, every operator has to suit the
property's type, and every value compared with has to be one the property can hold (its type, date format and pattern).
A test that does not fit is reported `errored` with each problem, and is not evaluated:

- `'<label>': '<path>' is not a property of <kind> (template <version>); did you mean '<nearest>'?`
- `'<label>': '<path>' is a list in <kind> (template <version>); equals compares one value, so test each item with '<path>[*]', or ask what the list contains.`
- `'<label>': '<path>' refers to master-data--Wellbore in <kind> (template <version>), never to master-data--Well.`
- `No template of <kind> is saved, so the test's fields cannot be checked against the kind's schema. Capture it on the Templates page (or with 'sqlflow template capture --kind <kind>'), then run the test again.`

A test that only counts, checks the index, legal tags or the ledger, or reads bulk data, needs no template.

## Records the index may not list yet

OSDU indexes a change from a queue, so for a while after records are written, removed or put back at an earlier version,
search lists them as they were, and a test judged then fails on records that are fine. Before a run judges anything it
reads from the ledger what this module's delivery flows changed in OSDU in the partition within each test's
`indexSettleSeconds`: records written, records taken out or put back at an earlier version, and records deleted from a
ledger that OSDU had held. A test whose entity type (its kind's, or for `ids` theirs) changed within its window is
`skipped`, and its result says which ledgers changed what, the latest change, and from when a run judges it. Other
versions of the same entity type count. A test that does not fit its template is reported as such whatever changed.

A skipped test does not fail the run. Changes other systems make are not in the ledger and are not waited for. With
`indexSettleSeconds: 0` a test is judged at once. The window says when a test is judged, not what it checks, so changing
it does not mark the test as changed.

## Outcomes

| Level | Outcomes |
| --- | --- |
| Assertion | `passed`, `failed`, `errored` (it could not find out: a refused query, an unreachable service, a limit passed, more records matched than the test reads) or `skipped`. A failed one keeps what it expected, what it found, how many it checked and failed, and the first failing records (`examples`), each with its id, value and reason. |
| Test | `errored` when an assertion errored or the test does not fit its template; else `failed` when an `error` assertion failed; `warned` when only `warning` ones did; `passed` otherwise (a failed `info` assertion is reported and changes nothing); `skipped` when it does not run in the partition or the index has not settled. |
| Run | `failed` when a test failed, else `errored` when one errored, else `passed`; `cancelled` when stopped, and `errored` when the run itself could not go on. A run whose tests failed or errored keeps, as its reason, how many did and which; a run that stopped keeps why, and records fewer results than tests. A run with no test to judge in its partition asks OSDU nothing and completes `passed`, its tests skipped. |

`failRunOn` decides whether the platform run fails: `error` (the default) on a failed or errored test, `warning` on a
warned one as well, `never` not at all. A run failed by its tests still carries its outcome, and its error names them:
`assertion flow '<name>' in partition '<p>': <n> of <m> test(s) evaluated, <k> passed; 1 failed on an assertion of severity error (log-headers).`
Notifications fire on it as on any failed run.

## Operations and the run payload

| Operation | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `test` (default) | Selects the tests, checks them against their templates, runs them (up to `reliability.concurrency` at once) and keeps the report. Needs the module's database. |
| `plan` | Selects and checks the same tests and counts what each matches and would read, evaluating nothing and recording nothing. It needs the module's database only for the templates. |

The payload takes `tests` (names) and `tags` and nothing else; a test runs when it is named or carries one of the tags,
and with neither every test runs. Each list holds at most 500 names, each once.

```bash
sqlflow run welldb-welllog-04-assertion.yaml --set partition=dev
sqlflow run welldb-welllog-04-assertion.yaml --set partition=dev --operation plan
sqlflow run welldb-welllog-04-assertion.yaml --set partition=dev --payload '{"tags":["smoke"],"tests":["log-curves"]}'
```

A name that is not a test fails the run: `Assertion flow '<name>' has no test named '<x>'; its tests are <names>.`, and so
does a tag no test carries. Any other payload property is refused before the run starts, for example
`payload recordKeys does not apply to an assertion flow: only a delivery flow's runs are scoped to records; an assertion flow's payload names only tests and tags.`
A schedule's `values` can name the partition and the parameters; a scheduled run runs every test. The values of a
schedule several flows join reach every one of them, so an assertion flow sharing its delivery flow's schedule declares
the delivery's parameters too, or fails with `parameter '<name>' is not declared under parameters.` On the control plane,
`${env:NAME}` references resolve from the central configuration (the partition's own values first) before the node's
environment. See [Running OSDU flows](../cli/run.md).

The run's `result` names the report (`assertionRunId`), `partition`, `status`, the counts (`tests`, `passed`, `failed`,
`warned`, `errored`, `skipped`) and the tests that did not pass first (`results`, at most 50, each with `test`, `kind`,
`outcome`, `matched` and the first failed assertions); a plan's lists each test with its `query`, `matched`, `wouldRead`,
`template`, `problems` and `error`.

## The report

Each run keeps one `osdu.AssertionRun` row and one `osdu.AssertionResult` row per test, written the moment the test
finishes, so a long run shows its progress and a stopped one keeps what it found. A result keeps the whole of what each
assertion found, up to 1,000,000 characters; past that it keeps fewer examples, marked as cut back. Each result carries
its test's definition hash, so a result that answers an earlier definition of the test shows as changed. See
[the ledger](../concepts/ledger.md).

Where to read it:

- The GUI: **OSDU**, **In OSDU**, **Tests** is the board of every assertion flow in the partition. An assertion flow's
  pipeline has a **Tests** tab (its board), a **History** tab (its tests against its runs) and a **Reports** tab (its
  runs); a report page runs the tests not passing again. A report page shows "The run stopped" only for a run that
  stopped (cancelled, or errored with fewer results than tests); a run whose tests errored shows its reason instead.
- The CLI: [sqlflow assertions](../cli/assertions.md) `list`, `status` and `report`.
- The API, every route a `GET` under `/api/v1/delivery`: `/assertions` (the board of every flow),
  `/flows/{pipelineId}/assertions` (one flow's board), `/flows/{pipelineId}/assertion-runs`,
  `/flows/{pipelineId}/assertion-matrix` (tests against runs), `/flows/{pipelineId}/assertions/{test}/history`,
  `/assertion-runs/{id}` (a run with every result) and `/assertion-runs/{id}/report?format=json|md|html|junit`. A read is
  in the partition `?partition=` names, else the `X-Osdu-Partition` header's, else the one a run would test.

A report renders as JSON, Markdown, self-contained HTML or JUnit XML (a suite per kind, a case per test: failed is a
failure, errored an error, skipped skipped, warned passes with its warnings in its output). The retention pass
(`POST /api/v1/delivery/ledger/prune`) removes a finished run older than its cut-off only whole, once a later result of
each of its tests superseded it, so every test's latest result stays.

## Lineage

The flow reads the kind of each test, in its one version, on its platform and partition, and writes nothing. That is
the type node the delivery flow writing the kind links to through its mapping's `template.kind`, so the delivery is
ordered before the tests, and a schedule firing both runs the tests after the records land. See
[Lineage](../concepts/lineage.md).

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tests per flow, names and tags per payload | 500 |
| Assertions per test | 100 |
| Tags per test | 20 |
| Ids per test | 1,000 |
| Values in `in`, `notIn`; rows in a `recordSet` | 1,000 |
| Fields in `unique`; columns in a `recordSet` | 20 |
| Records compared by `unique` | `maxRecords`, at most 1,000,000 |
| Conditions in a `where` | 10 |
| Distinct references per `resolves` | 200,000 |
| Distinct values per `distinct` | 1,000,000 |
| Distinct legal tags per `legal` | 10,000 |
| Time per value for `matches` | 1 second |

Past one of the last four, the assertion does not pass, and its result says why.

| `<test> reads records by ids, and names a query as well: a test reads the records its ids name, or the records a search finds, not both.` | `ids` with `query`, `spatial` or `sort`. |
| `<test>: query uses '{<token>}', which is neither {partition} nor declared under parameters.` | An undeclared token. |
| `<test> reads bulk data, and its kind '<kind>' is not one the Wellbore DDMS keeps bulk data for; it serves ...` | `bulk` on another kind. |
| `<test>: assert[<n>] is a monotonic assertion, which reads each record's bulk data; give the test a bulk block (bulk: { columns: [...] }).` | A bulk assertion without `bulk`. |
| `<test>: bulk.columns lists the only columns the test reads, and leaves out '<column>' (assert[<n>]); add it to bulk.columns, or leave bulk.columns out to read exactly the columns the assertions name.` | A `bulk.columns` list without a column an assertion names. |
| `source.auth.secretRef holds a literal value, and it is the credential the flow authenticates with (the token, the API key, the password or the client secret). A flow document holds references only: ...` | A literal secret. |
| `<test>: assert[<n>] names atLeast and atMost; a condition has one operator. Write between for a range, or one assertion for each.` | Two operators. |
| `<test>: assert[<n>].field '<path>' starts at '<root>', which is not a property of an OSDU record; ...` | A path that does not start at a record root. |
| `<test>: assert[<n>] asserts that every record meets its template, which needs each record as storage holds it; ... Take read: index out.` | `conforms` with `read: index`. |
| `<test>: assert[<n>] compares the records in order, and the test names no sort; ... Give the test a sort.` | `recordSet` `mode: ordered` without `sort`. |
| `source.headers names 'data-partition-id', and the flow names its partitions: every run sets the header to the partition it tests. Remove the header.` | Both ways of naming the partition. |
| `partitions[<i>] '<name>' is not a data-partition-id: letters, digits, underscore, hyphen and dot, at most 200 characters.` | A partition such as `*`. |
| `parameters declares 'partition', which an assertion flow keeps for the partition a run tests: {partition} in a test is always that partition. Rename the parameter.` | A parameter named `partition`. |
