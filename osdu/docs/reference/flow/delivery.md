# Delivery flow (flowType: delivery): deliver ingestion table rows to OSDU through a pinned mapping

A `flowType: delivery` document delivers records into an OSDU partition. It reads the keyed ingestion tables that
SQLFlow's own pre-ingestion and ingestion flows load ([ing flows](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/flow/ing.md)),
renders each record row with a pinned [mapping](mapping.md) into an OSDU record of the mapping's kind, sends what
rendered differently from what OSDU holds, and records every step in the ledger. Use it once the source's rows sit in a
keyed table: one row per record, a key that identifies it, and SQLFlow's system columns saying when it last changed.

A delivery document comes in two forms. The single form, described here, delivers one OSDU kind. The interface form
lists several kinds of one source under `interfaces`, sharing the connection, target and settings
([a source with interfaces](interfaces.md)). Both load into one model and run on one engine; every key on this page
means the same in both, with the differences named where they apply.

The loader is strict: an unknown key, a misspelled key or a key written twice is a load error naming the line, unlike
SQLFlow's own flow kinds, which ignore unknown keys. Run `sqlflow validate` after every edit; it loads the document
offline, with no catalog, database or OSDU ([cli-validate](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/cli/validate.md)).

## Minimal working example

The wellbore flow, `flows/welldb-wellbore-03-delivery.yaml`, as
[getting started](../guides/getting-started.md) builds it:

```yaml
flowType: delivery
name: welldb-wellbore-03-delivery
batch: welldb

partitions: [dev]

source:
  connection: ${env:OSDU_DATA_DB}
  record:
    object: OsduData.silver.Wellbore
    key: [wellbore_id]
    primaryKey: RecId
  lastModified: update_date
  work: ../.work/wellbore

render:
  mapping: Wellbore@1.0.0

target:
  endpoint: ${env:OSDU_URL}
  auth:
    type: oauth2ClientCredentials
    secondarySecretRef: ${env:OSDU_CLIENT_ID}
    secretRef: ${env:OSDU_CLIENT_SECRET}
    token:
      url: ${env:OSDU_TOKEN_URL}
      body:
        scope: ${env:OSDU_SCOPE}
  protocol: storage
```

```bash
sqlflow validate flows/welldb-wellbore-03-delivery.yaml
sqlflow check flows/welldb-wellbore-03-delivery.yaml
sqlflow run flows/welldb-wellbore-03-delivery.yaml --operation plan
sqlflow run flows/welldb-wellbore-03-delivery.yaml
```

`validate` prints `OK  'welldb-wellbore-03-delivery' is valid (delivery: OsduData.silver.Wellbore -> ${env:OSDU_URL}).`
[`sqlflow check`](../cli/check.md) then resolves the mapping against its saved template and the partition's cache, and a
`plan` run reports what a delivery would send without sending it ([running an OSDU flow](../cli/run.md)).

## A fuller example

The well log flow, `flows/welldb-welllog-03-delivery.yaml`: a child table, a flow parameter that scopes the run, a
business version column, a fan-out, a stop rule and a schedule:

```yaml
flowType: delivery
name: welldb-welllog-03-delivery
batch: welldb
description: Well logs from the well database, one WellLog record per log, written through the storage service.

partitions: [dev, test]

parameters:
  logSource:
    default: WIRELINE
    description: The log source a run delivers (the log_source column).

source:
  connection: ${env:OSDU_DATA_DB}
  record:
    object: OsduData.silver.WellLog
    key: [log_id]
    primaryKey: RecId
    scope:
      log_source: logSource
  datasets:
    curves:
      object: OsduData.silver.WellLogCurve
      join:
        log_id: log_id
      orderBy: [curve_id]
  lastModified: update_date
  work: ../.work/welllog/{logSource}

render:
  mapping: WellLog@1.0.0

target:
  endpoint: ${env:OSDU_URL}
  auth:
    type: oauth2ClientCredentials
    secondarySecretRef: ${env:OSDU_CLIENT_ID}
    secretRef: ${env:OSDU_CLIENT_SECRET}
    token:
      url: ${env:OSDU_TOKEN_URL}
      body:
        scope: ${env:OSDU_SCOPE}
  protocol: storage

## source

The flow reads the keyed ingestion tables SQLFlow loads, and nothing else: there is no drop folder, no manifest and no
replica, and the flow never extracts from a database of its own. `source.connection` names the database; `record` is the
table holding one row per record; each `datasets` entry is a child table joined to it by the record key; `payloads` say
where each record's files are.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `connection` | string | required | The database holding the ingestion tables, as a `${env:NAME}` or `${keyvault:vault/secret}` reference, or a SQL Server connection string whose password is such a reference. Resolved on the node that runs the flow ([connections and secrets](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/connections-and-secrets.md)). |
| `record.object` | string | required | The record table's three-part name, `[database].[schema].[table]` (`OsduData.silver.WellLog`). |
| `record.key` | list | required | The key columns, in order: the ing flow's `load.keyColumns`. They must name the same columns, in the same order, as the mapping's `dataset.key`. |
| `record.primaryKey` | string | none | The table's identity primary key (the ing flow's `target.identityColumn`, such as `RecId`). Required with `reliability.fanOut` above 0. See [The identity primary key](#the-identity-primary-key). |
| `record.scope` | map | none | Column to parameter: each entry becomes a typed `[column] = @parameter` predicate, so a run reads only the rows of its parameter values. The value is bound, never substituted into SQL. |
| `datasets.<name>.object` | string | required | A child table's three-part name. The mapping reads it under `<name>` (a `$forEach` over it, or `$dataset.<column>`). |
| `datasets.<name>.join` | map | required | Child column to record key column. Every record key column must be joined. |
| `datasets.<name>.orderBy` | list | none | The order of a record's child rows. |
| `datasets.<name>.maxRowsPerRecord` | integer | 100000 | The most child rows one record may carry, 1 to 1000000. A record over it is held. |
| `payloads.<name>.root` | string | required | The folder or storage prefix a record's files must sit under. Relative to the flow file; `{parameter}` tokens allowed. A `${...}` reference is refused: a location is not resolved from one. |
| `payloads.<name>.locationColumn` | string | none | The record column holding the record's folder, relative to `root` or absolute under it. Required when the route sends the payload. |
| `payloads.<name>.pattern` | string | `*` | A file name glob under the record's folder, without a path. |
| `payloads.<name>.hashColumn` | string | none | The record column holding the payload's content hash. Required unless `change.payloadDetect` is `lastModified`. |
| `payloads.<name>.chunkCountColumn` | string | none | The record column holding how many files the payload has, which spares a storage listing when planning. |
| `lastModified` | string | none | A business version column: a `datetime`, or RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 text (read as UTC without an offset). A row older than the version the ledger holds is never sent ([change detection](../concepts/change-detection.md)). |
| `systemColumns.updated` | string | `UpdatedDate_DW` | The column an incremental read windows on. Cannot be opted out of. |
| `systemColumns.deleted` | string | `DeletedDate_DW` | The soft-delete stamp, used when the table carries it. A row marked deleted is held, never delivered. |
| `systemColumns.inserted` | string | `InsertedDate_DW` | When the row first reached the table, used when the table carries it; dates the record's arrival on its history. |
| `systemColumns.fileName` | string | `FileName_DW` | The file the row was landed from, traced on every attempt; a column wider than 800 characters is refused. |
| `systemColumns.rowNumber` | string | `RowNumber_DW` | The row's position in that file: a whole-number column (an integer type, or `decimal`/`numeric` with scale 0 and at most 18 digits). A column of another type is refused; opt out with `~`. |
| `incremental.overlapSeconds` | integer | 900 | How far below the last watermark the next run reads again, 0 to 86400. |
| `incremental.pageSize` | integer | 1000 | Records per page, 1 to 100000. |
| `incremental.isolation` | `snapshot` \| `readCommitted` | `snapshot` | How a page's record rows and child rows see the database. `snapshot` reads them as one moment and needs `ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON`. |
| `incremental.commandTimeoutSeconds` | integer | 0 | Seconds a read may run; 0 is bounded by the run's cancellation alone. |
| `work` | string | required | Where the intake writes its work batches (the rendered documents the drains read back): a folder or storage prefix every node can write, relative to the flow file, with `{parameter}` tokens. A `${...}` reference is refused, as in a payload `root`. |

`updated` has to exist, named or left at its default. `deleted`, `inserted`, `fileName` and `rowNumber` named explicitly
have to exist: a run (and `sqlflow check --connect`) is refused naming the key, the column and the table, so a misspelt
provenance column never loses every record's origin without a word. Left at their defaults they are used only when the
table carries them. `~` opts a column out (`fileName: ~`), except `updated`. The
[provenance columns](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/concepts/provenance-and-row-keys.md) are SQLFlow's; a delivery
reads them as they are.

A location (`work`, a payload `root`) is substituted from the run's parameters and read as written, so a `${...}`
reference in it is refused when the flow loads:
`<file>: source.work '<location>' holds a ${...} reference, and a location is not resolved from one: write the path or storage URI itself, and vary it per run or environment with a {parameter} token declared under parameters.`

```yaml
source:
  connection: ${env:OSDU_DATA_DB}
  record:
    object: OsduData.silver.WellLog
    key: [log_id]
    primaryKey: RecId
  payloads:
    curves:
      root: ../data/curves/{logSource}
      locationColumn: curve_folder
      pattern: "*.parquet"
      hashColumn: payload_hash
      chunkCountColumn: chunk_count
  lastModified: update_date
  systemColumns:
    fileName: ~
  incremental:
    overlapSeconds: 900
    pageSize: 1000
    isolation: snapshot
  work: ../.work/welllog/{logSource}
```

Which payload a route sends, and the names `files` and `bulk` a route that sends both reads, are the route's
([routes](routes.md)). A record whose folder column is empty, climbs out with `..`, or points outside every root is held
with the reason.

### The identity primary key

`record.primaryKey` names an integer identity column that is the record table's own single-column primary key. SQLFlow's
ingestion creates it when the ing flow sets `target.identityColumn`. The record key still identifies a record, derives its
delivery key and OSDU id, and joins the child tables; the primary key is how rows are paged and dealt out:

- **Paging.** A read pages by the primary key; without one it pages by the record key.
- **Fan-out.** A flow with `reliability.fanOut` above 0 must name it. The coordinating run counts the candidates per
  range of primary key values and cuts them into contiguous slices, at most 1024, which its members plan
  ([submissions](../concepts/submissions.md)).

When a run opens the tables it refuses a declared column that is not an integer, not an identity column or not the
table's single-column primary key, and a record key with no unique index without a filter (a record held by two rows
could fall into two slices). The message gives the statement that adds the column:

```text
... An existing table needs it added once, which rewrites the table (drop a plain column of that name first):
ALTER TABLE [OsduData].[silver].[WellLog] ADD [RecId] bigint IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT [PK_WellLog] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED;
(NONCLUSTERED when the table already has a clustered index).
```

Run it while nothing loads the table. SQLFlow adds `target.identityColumn` only when it creates a table; set on an
existing one, it adds a plain nullable column, which a run refuses as not an identity column.

### What a run checks against the tables

Opening the source, a run (and `sqlflow check --connect`) reads the tables' columns and refuses, naming the key and the
table: a table the node cannot see, a column the flow names that the table does not hold (the message lists the
columns), a key column of a type that cannot be compared, an `updated` column that is not a date and time, a record row
whose key column is null in the run's scope, and the primary key rules above. A database that refuses snapshot isolation
fails the read with the statement that enables it, or `isolation: readCommitted`. Before it plans, a run also refuses a
`source.record.key` that differs from the mapping's `dataset.key`, and scope, `lastModified` and payload columns the
record table does not hold ([preflight](../concepts/preflight.md)).

## render

`render` is the only block that changes what a document is. Its values enter the render context recorded against every
record, so changing one renders the records again; everything else changes only how a document gets there
([change detection](../concepts/change-detection.md)).

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mapping` | string | required | The mapping, pinned as `Name@version` (`WellLog@1.0.0`). A floating reference is refused. |
| `cacheVersion` | string | `current` | Which version of the target partition's cache the mapping renders with: `current` takes the version current when the run starts; a label (`20261001T010000Z`) pins one. Refused for a flow that names several partitions or serves the registry. |
| `parameters` | map | none | Values for the parameters the mapping declares, as literals or `${env:...}` / `${keyvault:...}` references. |
| `mappings` | string | none | The folder the mappings are read from, relative to the flow file. Left out, the nearest `mappings` folder walking up from the flow file. |

A mapping `WellLog@1.0.0` is the file `WellLog@1.0.0.yaml` (or `WellLog/1.0.0.yaml`) in that folder, and the file must
declare the same name and version. A flow reads the cache of the partition it delivers to and names no cache: a
document that still declares `render.cache` is refused ([partition cache](../concepts/partition-cache.md)).

The four parameters every OSDU record needs belong to the kind rather than to a flow. When the mapping declares one and
the flow supplies no value, it takes a reference that resolves from the central configuration or the node's environment:

| Mapping parameter | Default when the flow leaves it out |
| --- | --- |
| `dataPartition` | the partition the run is bound to, for a flow that works in partitions; the flow's `target.headers.data-partition-id`, as written, for a flow bound by its header; `${env:OSDU_DATA_PARTITION}` only for a flow bound to no partition |
| `aclOwner` | `${env:OSDU_ACL_OWNER}` |
| `aclViewer` | `${env:OSDU_ACL_VIEWER}` |
| `legalTag` | `${env:OSDU_LEGAL_TAG}` |

A value the flow supplies always wins, and references are resolved before the render context is built, so the context
holds the value that reached the record. A flow that names its partitions, or serves the registry, may not set
`dataPartition`: every run mints its ids in the partition it targets.

## change

| Key | Values | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `detect` | `renderedHash` \| `always` | `renderedHash` | A document is sent when the hash of what it renders to differs from what the ledger holds; `always` sends every record read. |
| `payloadDetect` | `contentHash` \| `lastModified` \| `always` | `contentHash` | A payload is sent when its hash column moves; `lastModified` takes its files' modified times as its watermark; `always` sends it every time. |
| `onUnchanged` | `skip` \| `deliver` | `skip` | `deliver` sends a record read whose document and payload are unchanged. |
| `useSourceVersions` | boolean | `true` | The tier-0 gate: an incremental run whose window holds no changed row, and no record waiting to be planned again, completes without reading a record. |

`detect: lastModified` and `detect: contentHash` are refused (the business version column is `source.lastModified`), so
is `payloadDetect: renderedHash`, and so is `payloadDetect: lastModified` on a route that sends no payload files. What
each decision reads is on [change detection](../concepts/change-detection.md).

## target

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | string | required | The OSDU platform root every service is reached under, usually `${env:OSDU_URL}` (a single-form flow on the ddms route may point at the DDMS itself; see [DDMSs](ddms.md#the-endpoint-the-platform-root-or-the-ddms-itself)). Changing it never redelivers a record by itself. A URL written literally whose user info or query carries a credential is refused. |
| `auth` | map | `type: none` | How every request authenticates. See below. |
| `headers` | map | none | Extra headers on every request. `data-partition-id` here hard-codes the flow's one partition. A header that carries a credential (`Authorization`, an API or subscription key, a token, any `x-api-*` header) holds a reference, after its scheme when it has one (`Bearer ${env:NAME}`); a literal is refused when the flow is read. |
| `protocol` | string | required in the single form | The route the records go by: `storage`, `file`, `dataset`, `manifest`, `ddms`, `fileAndDdms`, `manifestAndDdms`, `workflow`, `dspdm` or `etp` ([routes](routes.md)). |
| `protocolOptions` | map | none | The route's options ([routes](routes.md#options-every-route-reads)). |
| `ddms`, `eds`, `dspdm`, `etp` | map | none | The DDMSs and services some routes deliver to ([DDMSs](ddms.md), [DDMS shapes and services](ddms-services.md)). |
| `workflow`, `airflow` | map | none | The workflow route's declaration ([routes](routes.md)). |
| `verifyReferences` | `none` \| `storage` | `none` | `storage` asks OSDU's storage service, before a record is sent, about the ids it refers to that no record of the ledger holds, and holds a record naming one storage does not hold ([preflight](../concepts/preflight.md#references-checked-in-storage)). Refused on the `dspdm` route. |
| `validation.mode` | `report` \| `enforce` | `report` | What the gate before a record is sent does with a record that breaks its schema: send it and record the verdict, or hold it ([preflight](../concepts/preflight.md#validation-before-a-record-is-sent)). |
| `validation.unverified` | `send` \| `hold` | `send` | What it does with a record some part of which could not be checked. |

The names the routes carried before (`osduRecord`, `osduWellLog`, `osduFile`, `osduManifest`, `osduDataset`,
`osduFileAndDdms`, `osduManifestAndDdms`, `osduWorkflow`, `osduDspdm`, `osduEtp`) still load. In the interface form each
interface's route follows from what it declares, so `target.protocol` is refused at the source level.

### target.auth

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | `none`, `bearer`, `apiKeyHeader`, `basic` or `oauth2ClientCredentials`. |
| `secretRef` | The token (`bearer`), the key (`apiKeyHeader`), the password (`basic`) or the client secret (`oauth2ClientCredentials`). Required for `bearer`, `apiKeyHeader` and `basic`. A reference only: a literal is refused when the flow is read. |
| `secondarySecretRef` | The user name (`basic`) or the client id (`oauth2ClientCredentials`): an identifier, so a literal is allowed. |
| `headerName` | The header an `apiKeyHeader` key goes in. Required for that type. |
| `valuePrefix` | Text written before the value: `Bearer` and a space by default for `bearer`, nothing for `apiKeyHeader`. |
| `token.url` | The token endpoint (`oauth2ClientCredentials`). Written literally, its user info and query may carry no credential. |
| `token.discoveryUrl` | An OIDC discovery document whose `token_endpoint` is used instead of `url`. The same rule as `url`. |
| `token.body` | Form fields of the token request (`scope`). `grant_type: client_credentials`, `client_id` and `client_secret` are added from the refs when the body leaves them out. A field named as a secret (`client_secret`, `password`, `refresh_token`, `client_assertion`, ...) holds a reference; `client_id`, `scope` and `audience` may be literals. |
| `token.basicAuthClient` | `true` sends the client id and secret as a Basic header instead of in the body. Default `false`. |
| `token.tokenPath` | Where the token is in the response. Default `access_token`. |
| `token.applyPrefix` | Text written before the token in `Authorization`. Default `"Bearer "` (with its space). |

`oauth2ClientCredentials` needs a `token` block. A token is reused until a minute before it expires (its `expires_in`, or
30 minutes when the response gives none). Every secret is a reference; a literal one is refused when the flow is read,
naming the key and never the value:

```text
<file>: target.auth.secretRef holds a literal value, and it is the credential the flow authenticates with (the token, the API key, the password or the client secret). A flow document holds references only: write ${keyvault:vault/secret} or ${env:NAME}, and keep the value in the key vault or the environment of the nodes that run the flow (locally, the git-ignored .sqlflow/env file).
```

The same rule holds for `target.airflow.auth` and `target.airflow.headers`. The secret references the target declares
are what the catalog lists as the flow's credential references.

## Parameters

A flow parameter is a run value supplied with `--set name=value`, a trigger's values or a schedule's `values`.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parameters.<name>.required` | boolean | `false` | A run without a value fails with `parameter '<name>' is required. Supply it with --set <name>=value or the run's values.` |
| `parameters.<name>.default` | string | none | The value a run without one takes. |
| `parameters.<name>.description` | string | none | Free text. |

`{name}` tokens are substituted in `source.work` and every payload `root`; a value carrying `/`, `\` or `..` is refused
there, since these locations bound what a run reads and writes. `source.record.scope` binds a parameter to a column
instead. A token or a scope naming an undeclared parameter is refused when the document loads, and a run supplying an
undeclared one is refused when it starts. Each distinct set of values is a scope of its own, with its own watermark.

Mapping parameters are different: they go under `render.parameters` ([render](#render)).

## Partitions

A flow says which partitions it delivers to along one of three paths ([partitions](../concepts/partitions.md)):

| The flow declares | It delivers to |
| --- | --- |
| `partitions: [dev, test]` (or `{ name: dev, keepLedger: true }` entries) | the partitions it names; a run targets one of them |
| `target.headers.data-partition-id: dev` | that one partition |
| neither | every partition registered with the catalog (`sqlflow partition add`), the run's choice or the registry's default |

A run names its partition with the run value `partition` (`--set partition=test`, a schedule's `values`); the
module's own verbs take `--partition`. Each partition keeps a ledger of its own, named `<ledger>@<partition>`;
`keepLedger` marks the one partition that keeps the ledger the flow kept before it served partitions (on the entry for a
flow that names them, at the top level for one that serves the registry). A flow that works in partitions declares no
`data-partition-id` header, no `render.parameters.dataPartition` and no parameter called `partition`.

| `concurrency` | integer | 8 | Records a worker delivers at once; verify and reverse runs work this many at once too. At least 1. |
| `retry.attempts` | integer | 4 | The tries a request that is safe to repeat gets after a transport failure or a 408, 425, 429, 503 or 504; and the attempts a record gets before it is failed for good. At least 1. |
| `retry.backoff` | `exponential` \| `fixed` | `exponential` | The wait between tries of a request. |
| `retry.baseDelayMs`, `retry.maxDelayMs` | integer | 500, 30000 | The first and the longest wait between tries of a request. |
| `retry.honorRetryAfter` | boolean | `true` | Never ask again sooner than a `Retry-After` header says; a wait longer than `maxDelayMs` is left to the record's next try. |
| `retry.recordBaseDelayMinutes`, `retry.recordMaxDelayMinutes` | integer | 1, 60 | The wait before a record that failed gets another try, doubling per attempt up to the maximum. |
| `skipStatusCodes` | list | none | More statuses that hold a record instead of trying it again (`HTTP <status> is not retryable`). 400, 403, 404, 405, 409, 413, 415 and 422 hold it whatever the list says. |
| `timeoutSeconds` | integer | 100 | The timeout of one request. |
| `rateLimitRps` | number | 0 | Requests per second; 0 is unlimited. |
| `verifyTls` | boolean | `true` | `false` accepts any certificate, and only on a node that sets `SQLFLOW_DELIVERY_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=true`; elsewhere the run is refused. |
| `urlAllowlist` | list | none | Hosts requests may reach; `*.example.com` matches the domain and its subdomains. Checked on every redirect, and a redirect from https to http is refused. |
| `maxResponseBytes` | integer | 67108864 | The largest response read. |
| `maxRequestBodyBytes` | integer | 0 | The target's request body ceiling; a bigger chunk holds the record before anything is sent. 0 declares none ([DDMSs](ddms.md)). |
| `leaseSeconds` | integer | 300 | How long a worker's lease on a record lasts (at least 30 is used) before another node may take it. |
| `batchSize` | integer | 50 | Records claimed from the ledger in one round trip. |
| `batchRecords` | integer | 500 | Rendered documents per work batch file, 1 to 100000: one claim of a drain, one unit of progress. |
| `fanOut` | integer | 0 | Member runs a large submission spreads over, 0 to 64. Needs `source.record.primaryKey`. |
| `fanOutMinRecords` | integer | 1000 | Below this many candidates a submission never fans out. At least 1. |
| `renderParallelism` | integer | 0 | Renderers on one node, 0 to 256; 0 is half the processors, at least one. |
| `parallelInterfaces` | integer | 4 | The interface form only: how many interfaces of one wave run at once, 1 to 32 ([interfaces](interfaces.md#order)). |

How a submission is planned, cut, leased and drained across nodes is on [submissions](../concepts/submissions.md); what
happens to a record that fails, is held or waits is on [record lifecycle](../concepts/record-lifecycle.md).

## verify

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `verify.reconcile` | boolean | `false` | A verify run compares OSDU's version of each delivered record with the ledger's; with `true` it also marks each drifted or missing record for redelivery of all of it, as a redelivery does, named under the verify's activity; the flow's next deliver run reads it by key and sends it again, whatever its incremental window reads. Send again sends it at once. |

## failWhen

A record with a data problem is held and the run goes on. `failWhen` says when the records' failures add up to a failure
of the run itself, in a deliver, replan or drain run:

| Key | The run stops when | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `outageFailures` | this many records in a row could not reach the service (transport failure, timeout, HTTP 408, 429 or 5xx) or were refused by it (401 or 403), none delivered in between; 0 turns it off | 25 |
| `consecutiveFailures` | this many records in a row failed with problems of one class (data, connection or permission) | not set |
| `failedPercent` | held and failed records reach this share (above 0, at most 100) of the records settled, once `minRecords` have settled | not set |
| `minRecords` | how many records settle before `failedPercent` is judged | 100 |

A stopped run hands back the records it had not sent without charging them a try, closes its submission as failed
(`stopped: <why>`) and ends failed; the next run sends what is left. In the interface form the same rules stop one
interface ([when an interface stops](interfaces.md#when-an-interface-stops)).

## Schedules

The `schedule:` key is SQLFlow's ([schedule](../../../../sqlflow/docs/reference/flow/schedule.md)): a schedule name, a
list of names, or an inline cron or interval with its time zone. There is no scope: a fire runs every flow that joined
the schedule. A delivery flow uses two more keys of it, which SQLFlow passes to flows of a registered kind:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `operation` | What every fire runs; `deliver` when left out. |
| `values` | Run values every fire supplies: the flow's parameters, and `partition`. |

A fire supplies nothing on its own, so a flow with a required parameter gives the schedule a value for it, or every fired
run fails with `parameter '<name>' is required`. The schedule's operation is checked against the operations below when
the document loads; its values are checked by each run, as a trigger's are.

| Operation | What a run does |
| --- | --- |
| `deliver` | Plans the rows the ingestion tables changed and delivers what renders differently (the default). |
| `plan` | Reports what a delivery would send, changing nothing. |
| `intake` | Plans rows into work batches without delivering them: a fan-out member's share. |
| `drain` | Delivers the work batches a submission already planned. |
| `verify` | Compares what OSDU holds with what the ledger recorded. |
| `replan` | Reads every row of the scope again and delivers what renders differently now. |
| `sync` | Reads the ledger's records from the ingestion tables and consolidates the ledger; sends nothing. |
| `reverse` | Puts OSDU back as it was before one run or submission. |
| `undo` | Undoes what deliveries that did not complete left in OSDU. |
| `delete-ledger` | Removes every record of the ledger from OSDU (reversibly), then deletes the ledger; the payload names the partition to confirm. |

The payload each operation takes, the result and the exit codes are on [running an OSDU flow](../cli/run.md).

## Validation errors

Every message starts with the file. A sample of what `sqlflow validate` refuses:

| Cause | Message |
| --- | --- |
| A floating mapping | `render.mapping 'WellLog' must be pinned as 'Name@version'; floating references are not allowed.` |
| No route in the single form | `'target.protocol' is required.` |
| An unknown key | `invalid YAML at line 28, column 3 - Property 'replica' not found on type 'SqlFlow.Delivery.Documents.FlowSourceYaml'.` |
| A two-part table name | `source.record.object 'silver.WellLog' must be a three-part name [database].[schema].[table]: it has 2 part(s).` |
| A child join missing a key column | `source.datasets.curves.join does not cover key column 'log_source' of the record table; every key column must be joined, or a child row could belong to several records.` |
| A scope on an undeclared parameter | `source.record.scope binds column 'log_source' to parameter 'source', which is not declared under parameters.` |
| An undeclared token | `source.work uses '{source}', which is not declared under parameters.` |
| A reference in a location | `source.work '${env:WORK_ROOT}' holds a ${...} reference, and a location is not resolved from one: write the path or storage URI itself, and vary it per run or environment with a {parameter} token declared under parameters.` |
| A literal password | `source.connection carries a literal password. A flow document holds references only: put the connection string, or its password, behind ${keyvault:vault/secret} or ${env:NAME}, or connect with Azure AD (Authentication=Active Directory Default).` |
| A literal secret | `target.auth.secretRef holds a literal value, and it is the credential the flow authenticates with (the token, the API key, the password or the client secret). A flow document holds references only: ...` |
| A literal credential header | `target.headers.Authorization holds a literal value, and the header carries a credential; it holds a reference, after its scheme when it has one (Bearer ${env:NAME}). ...` |
| A pinned mapping that is not there | `render.mapping: Mapping 'Wellbore@1.0.0' was not found under '../mappings'. Expected one of: Wellbore@1.0.0.yaml, Wellbore@1.0.0.yml, 1.0.0.yaml, 1.0.0.yml.` |
| A fan-out without a primary key | `reliability.fanOut spreads a submission over ranges of the record table's identity primary key, and source.record.primaryKey names none. ...` |
| A header beside `partitions` | `target.headers names 'data-partition-id', and the flow names its partitions: every run sets the header to the partition it targets. Remove the header.` |
| A pinned cache version with several partitions | `render.cacheVersion pins version 20261001T010000Z, which is a version of one partition's cache, and the flow names 2 partitions, each rendering against its own partition's cache. ...` |
| `render.cache` | `render.cache is not a setting any more: a flow reads the cache of the partition it delivers to (target.headers.data-partition-id), which every cache flow of that partition fills. Remove render.cache.` |
| A missing hash column | `the flow decides payload changes by content hash, so source.payloads.curves.hashColumn must name the record column holding it; or take the files' modified times instead with change.payloadDetect: lastModified.` |
| OAuth without a token block | `target.auth of type oauth2ClientCredentials needs a 'token' block with the token endpoint url and body.` |

`validate` also finds and reads the mapping the flow pins, as a run finds it (`render.mappings`, else the nearest
`mappings` folder walking up), and refuses the flow when it is missing or does not load. What validate cannot check (the
mapping against its template, the cache, the tables, the order of interfaces) is checked by `sqlflow check` and by every
run before anything is sent ([preflight](../concepts/preflight.md)).
