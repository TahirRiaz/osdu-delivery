# Mapping value nodes: $from, $value, $when, $required, $coalesce, $forEach, lists and open objects

Every property in a [mapping's](mapping.md) `record` tree is a node that says where its value comes from. This page is
the reference for those nodes: reading a column, writing a literal, deciding when a property applies and what an empty
value does, taking the first of several sources, repeating a child dataset's rows as an array, and filling lists and
open objects. Every word of the mapping language starts with `$`; every other key is a property of the record.

## An example

A wellbore mapping for `osdu:wks:master-data--Wellbore:1.3.0`, its record table `OsduData.silver.Wellbore` (key
`wellbore_id`):

```yaml
record:
  acl:
    owners: ["{$param.aclOwner}"]
    viewers:
      - "{$param.aclViewer}"           # a literal every record carries
      - $from: viewer_group            # and a group the row names, when it names one
        $required: false
  legal:
    legaltags: ["{$param.legalTag}"]
    otherRelevantDataCountries: [NO]
  data:
    FacilityName:                      # a column, trimmed
      $from: wellbore_name
      $modifiers: [trim]
    FacilityID: { $from: wellbore_id }
    Source: welldb                     # a literal
    SequenceNumber:                    # an integer property: the column's text "2" is written as 2
      $from: sequence_number
      $required: false                 # no sequence number leaves the property out
    FacilityDescription:
      $coalesce:                       # the first alternative that gives a value
        - $from: wellbore_remark
        - $expr: wellbore_name & " (" & wellbore_uwi & ")"
      $description: The source's remark, else the name and the UWI.
    NameAliases:                       # a list of objects, each item laid out as the record is
      - AliasName: { $from: wellbore_uwi }
      - AliasName:
          $from: wellbore_short_name
          $required: false             # an item none of whose properties gives a value adds nothing
    VerticalMeasurements:
      - VerticalMeasurementID: KB
        VerticalMeasurement: { $from: kb_elevation }
        VerticalMeasurementTypeID: "{$param.dataPartition}:reference-data--VerticalMeasurementType:KellyBushing:"
      - VerticalMeasurementID:
          $value: RT
          $when: not empty(rt_elevation)
        VerticalMeasurement:
          $from: rt_elevation
          $required: false
        VerticalMeasurementTypeID:
          $value: "{$param.dataPartition}:reference-data--VerticalMeasurementType:RotaryTable:"
          $when: not empty(rt_elevation)
    ExtensionProperties:               # an open object: laid out as the record is, values written as they arrive
      WellDb:
        Status:
          $from: wellbore_status
          $required: false
```

This block, under the header of `mappings/Wellbore@1.0.0.yaml` (system `welldb`, key `[wellbore_id]`, the four
parameters `dataPartition`, `aclOwner`, `aclViewer` and `legalTag`), validates with `sqlflow validate`.

## The words of a value node

A value node reads its value with exactly one of these:

| Word | Reads |
| --- | --- |
| `$from` | A column: a bare name reads the row the node is in, `$dataset.<column>` the record table's row from anywhere. |
| `$expr` | A value an [expression](mapping-expressions.md) computes from the row: `coalesce(log_name, log_source)`. |
| `$value` | A literal written as it is: text, a number, a boolean, a list or an object. |
| `$cache` | A field of the cached record `$findBy` finds (`UnitOfMeasure.id`), or of every row `$findAll` finds. See [mapping lookups](mapping-lookups.md). |
| `$search` | The id of the one record a search of the platform finds by `$findBy`, in one of the mapping's `searches`. See [mapping lookups](mapping-lookups.md). |
| `$lookup` | A field of the record a lookup of the `lookups` block finds (`wellbore.id`). See [mapping lookups](mapping-lookups.md). |
| `$coalesce` | The first of two or more alternatives that gives a value. See [$coalesce](#coalesce-the-first-value-that-is-there). |

and takes its settings beside it:

| Setting | Meaning | Taken by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$modifiers` | Changes to an incoming dataset value, top to bottom. See [mapping modifiers](mapping-modifiers.md). | `$from`, `$expr`, `$cache`, `$search` |
| `$when` | A condition: when the property applies to the row. See [$when](#when-when-a-property-applies). | every node |
| `$required` | What an empty value does: `true` (the default) holds the record, `false` leaves the property out. See [$required](#required-what-an-empty-value-does). | every node but `$value` |
| `$description` | Free text. | every node |
| `$findBy` | Which record to read: one line or a list, tried in order. | `$cache`, `$search` |
| `$findAll` | Every cached row that matches, read as a list. | `$cache` |
| `$ignoreSeparators` | A last attempt at matching with punctuation and spacing folded away. | `$cache` |
| `$unverified` | Write an id an `id` or `ref` modifier builds even when the cache does not hold its record. See [mapping modifiers](mapping-modifiers.md). | `$from`, `$expr` with `id` or `ref` |

A `$value` takes only `$when` and `$description`; a `$lookup` takes only `$when`, `$required` and `$description`; a
`$coalesce` takes `$when`, `$required` and `$description` beside its list; a `$forEach` takes `$item`, `$where`,
`$when`, `$required` and `$description`. Anything else is refused by name, such as
`record.data.Description: a literal $value takes only $when and $description beside it; $findBy, $findAll, $modifiers, $required, $ignoreSeparators and $unverified belong to a node that reads the dataset, the cache or a search.`

## Reading a column: $from

`$from: <column>` writes the value of one column. A bare name reads the row the node is in: the record table's row, or
under a `$forEach` the child row. `$dataset.<column>` reads the record table's row from anywhere, inside a `$forEach`
included. Column names are letters, digits, `_` and `-`, and are matched ignoring case. Every column a mapping reads is
checked against the flow's ingestion tables before a run ([preflight](../concepts/preflight.md)).

The form the language used to write is refused with the one to write now:

```text
record.data.Name: $from: 'dataset.log_name' reads a column the way the mapping language no longer writes it: a column of the dataset's own row is $dataset.log_name, and a column of the dataset's own row is log_name alone.
```

A column holding blank text is no value, the same as a missing one.

## Literals and $value

A property written as a plain value is a literal, carried by every record: `Source: welldb`, `ReferenceCurveID: MD`,
`Tags: [welldb, well-log]`. A literal's text reads a parameter as `{$param.<name>}` and nothing else, so
`"{$param.dataPartition}:reference-data--VerticalMeasurementType:KellyBushing:"` becomes
`dev:reference-data--VerticalMeasurementType:KellyBushing:` in partition `dev`. Any other `{$...}` token, or a parameter
written without its marker, is refused:

```text
record.data.Name: the literal '{$dataset.log_name} run' holds {$dataset.log_name}, and a literal reads only a parameter, {$param.<name>}; read a column's value with $from, and build an id from values with the id modifier.
```

Text in braces that is not a token, such as `{log_name}`, is written as it stands. An unquoted YAML scalar keeps the
type YAML reads it as (`Count: 5` is a number, `Count: "5"` is text), and the template's type decides what the record
carries ([below](#how-a-value-takes-its-propertys-type)).

`$value` is a literal with settings: a text, number, boolean, list or object written as it is, with a `$when` and a
`$description` beside it. Use it for a literal that applies only on some rows, or for an object written whole:

```yaml
LogRemark:
  $value: Reprocessed by the vendor
  $when: log_status = "REPROCESSED"
```

A map of properties is an object laid out property by property; to write an object as one literal, wrap it in
`$value`. An empty object is written `{ $value: {} }`, and an empty `$value` is refused
(`$value is empty; leave the property out by removing it.`). A list of objects written entirely as literals is carried
by every record as it is. A literal takes no `$required`: it always has a value.

A property whose own name starts with `$` is written with one more `$` in the tree (`$$Odd: kept` writes `"$Odd": "kept"`);
what `$value` holds is written verbatim.

## Computing a value: $expr

`$expr` writes the value an [expression](mapping-expressions.md) computes from the row, the record table's row and the
parameters. The value then passes through `$modifiers` and `$required` like a column's, so `$expr` takes the settings
`$from` takes. An expression that reads no column is refused, since it would give every record the same value; write it
as a literal.

## From the cache or the platform

`$cache`, `$search` and `$lookup` read values the source row does not hold: a record of the partition's cache, a record
the platform is searched for, or a record a named lookup finds once per row. `$findBy` says which record, `$findAll`
reads every matching cached row as a list, and `$ignoreSeparators` loosens a name match. [Mapping lookups](mapping-lookups.md)
documents all of them. `$modifiers` on such a node change the dataset value its `$findBy` compares; what the cache or the
platform gives is never modified.

## Changing a value: $modifiers

`$modifiers` is a list applied top to bottom to the incoming value: `trim`, `upper`, `lower`, `split`, `replace`,
`equals`, `date`, `number`, `id` and `ref`. `id` and `ref` build an OSDU id from the value and are always last;
`$unverified: true` lets an id they build go out when the cache holds records of its entity type but not this one.
[Mapping modifiers](mapping-modifiers.md) documents each.

## $when: when a property applies

`$when` is a condition, an [expression](mapping-expressions.md) that gives true or false, read against the row the node
is in. When it does not hold, the property is left out for that row whatever `$required` says. A condition that the row
gives a value it cannot test (text where a number is compared) holds the record with the reason, because whether the
property belongs in the record is then unknown.

- On a value node, a `$coalesce` or a `$lookup`, it decides for that property.
- On a `$forEach`, it decides for the whole array and reads the record table's row; `$where` decides for each child row.
- On a property of an item of a list of objects, it decides for that property; an item has no settings of its own.
- The four access and legal lists themselves take none: they apply to every record. A value node among the items of
  `acl.owners` or `acl.viewers` may have one.

## $required: what an empty value does

`$required` is `true` by default: a value the node should give and does not holds the record, and the ledger records why.
`$required: false` leaves the property out instead. It never introduces a value, and it never lets a mistake through.

| Situation | `$required: true` (default) | `$required: false` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The column, or what `$expr` gives, is empty after the modifiers | Record held | Property left out |
| The cache holds no record `$findBy` finds, or no row `$findAll` finds | Record held | Property left out |
| An `id` or `ref` builds an id of an entity type the cache holds, and the cache holds no record with that id | Record held (unless `$unverified`) | Property left out (unless `$unverified`) |
| A token of an `id` template has no value | Record held | Property left out |
| No record on the platform matches a search | Record held | Property left out |
| No alternative of a `$coalesce` gives a value | Record held, naming why each gave nothing | Property left out |
| A `$forEach` finds no child row, none its `$where` keeps, or none that gives its item a value | Record held | List written empty |
| `$when` does not hold | Property left out | Property left out |
| Several cached records answer to the value | Record held | Record held |
| Several platform records match, the search is refused, or the value cannot be searched for | Record held | Record held |
| A `date` or `number` modifier cannot read the value, or the value cannot take the property's type | Record held | Record held |
| An expression or a condition meets a value it cannot work with | Record held | Record held |

A held record's reason names the variable and what was missing:

```text
osdu.data.TechnicalAssurances[].Comment: dataset.remark is empty, and the entry is required
osdu.data.Depth: nullif(depth, -999) * 0.3048 gives no value, and the entry is required
osdu.data.Curves: dataset.curves has no rows with values, and the entry is required
```

A property the schema requires in `data` must not be `$required: false`; the [preflight](../concepts/preflight.md)
refuses that, since the record could go out without it.

## $coalesce: the first value that is there

A property is often best taken from one place and, where that gives nothing, from another. A `$coalesce` node lists its
alternatives in the order they are tried, each a value node of its own with its own `$findBy`, `$modifiers`,
`$ignoreSeparators` and `$unverified`, and writes the first that gives a value:

```yaml
Name:
  $coalesce:
    - $from: log_name
    - $from: log_source
      $modifiers: [upper]
    - $value: unnamed              # a literal is the last alternative
  $description: The log's own name, else its source.
```

- **A miss passes to the next alternative**: an empty value, no cached record, a key a lookup table does not list, a
  search that finds nothing, an id the partition's cache holds no record under.
- **A mistake holds the record**, as the alternative would on its own: a date that is not a date, a value several
  records answer to, a search the platform refuses. What it would have given is unknown rather than absent, so a later
  alternative never stands in for it.
- **A search not asked yet stops the node** until the answer is in, so a later alternative never stands in for an
  earlier one the platform has not been asked.
- **`$when`, `$required` and `$description` go beside `$coalesce`** and decide for all the alternatives; written in an
  alternative they are refused. When none gives a value, `$required` decides, and a held record names why each gave
  nothing (`none of the 3 alternatives of $coalesce gives a value, and the entry is required: 1. ...; 2. ...; 3. ...`).
- **An alternative reads one value**: it is not a `$forEach` or a `$coalesce` of its own, and a literal (`$value`) can
  only be the last, so a `$coalesce` ending in one fills its property on every row.
- **What every alternative tried read from the cache is recorded**, so a later cache version that would let an earlier
  alternative give a value reaches the record. A preview (`sqlflow preview`) says which alternative gave each value.

A `$coalesce` lists two or more alternatives:
`$coalesce lists 1 alternative, and it takes the first of two or more that gives a value; one alternative is a node of its own, written without $coalesce.`
For values computed from columns alone, the `coalesce()` function of an [expression](mapping-expressions.md) is often
simpler.

## $forEach: repeated arrays from a child dataset

A `$forEach` node fills an array of objects with one item per row of a child dataset: a table the flow declares under
`source.datasets` by that name, joined to the record table on the record key ([delivery flow](delivery.md)). `$item` lays
out the properties each row fills, and its bare column names read the child row:

```yaml
Curves:
  $forEach: curves
  $where: curve_id != "DEPT" and not empty(curve_unit)
  $item:
    CurveID: { $from: curve_id }
    TopDepth: { $from: top_depth }
    BaseDepth: { $from: base_depth }
    CurveDescription:
      $expr: coalesce(curve_description, curve_id & " of " & $dataset.log_name)
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `$forEach` | The child dataset whose rows become the items (letters, digits, `_` and `-`). |
| `$item` | The properties each row fills, each a node as anywhere in the tree. |
| `$where` | A condition each child row must hold to become an item, read against the child row. |
| `$when` | Whether the array is written at all, read against the record table's row. |
| `$required` | `true` (default) holds a record that ends with no item; `false` writes the list empty. |
| `$description` | Free text. |

An item none of whose properties gives a value is left out of the array. Two `$forEach` nodes may repeat the same child
dataset (the curves of a log, and the source's own notes about them in `ExtensionProperties`). A path steps into one array
at most, so these are refused by name:

| Refused | Message |
| --- | --- |
| A `$forEach` inside a `$forEach`'s item | `record.data.Curves.$item.Samples repeats rows inside the items of the $forEach over curves; a repeated array inside a repeated item is not supported.` |
| A `$forEach` inside an item of a list of objects | `... repeats rows inside an item of the list of objects at record.data.TechnicalAssurances; a repeated array inside the item of a list is not supported.` |
| An array of values from rows | `record.data.Tags.$item is a node that reads one value, and the items of a repeated array are objects here: ... An array of values from rows is not supported yet.` |
| No `$item` | `record.data.Curves repeats the rows of curves and lays out no item; $item names each property a row fills, such as $item: { CurveID: { $from: curve_id } }.` |
| `$item` without `$forEach` | `record.data.Curves lays out $item, the items of an array whose rows a $forEach node repeats; add $forEach: <child dataset>.` |
| A value read beside `$forEach` | `... repeats rows with $forEach and reads a value with $from; a node does one of them. What each row gives is a property under $item.` |

## Lists of values

A list some of whose items are value nodes is a list of values: each item is a literal or a value node (a `$findAll`
among them), and the list is what they give, one after another, a value given twice (whatever its case) written once
where it is first given. An item that gives nothing adds nothing; one that holds holds the record, as it would on its
own. A list none of whose items gives a value is written empty, since the mapping defines it.

```yaml
viewers:
  - "{$param.aclViewer}"           # a literal every record carries
  - $from: viewer_group            # and a group the row names, when it names one
    $required: false
```

An item is never a list, a `$coalesce` (write each alternative as an item: the list keeps every value its items give) or
a `$forEach`. `acl.owners` and `acl.viewers` take a list of values with at least one literal; the legal lists take
literals only ([mapping](mapping.md#access-and-legal-lists)).

## Lists of objects

A list some of whose items are objects is a list of objects. Each item is an object laid out as the record tree lays out
an object: its properties are literals, objects, value nodes, `$coalesce` nodes or lists of values, with their own
`$modifiers`, `$when` and `$required`, and they read the record table's row. Each property fills the variable of the
list's items it names (`record.data.TechnicalAssurances[0].TechnicalAssuranceTypeID` fills
`osdu.data.TechnicalAssurances[].TechnicalAssuranceTypeID`) and is converted to that variable's type; a `ref` builds the
reference of the entity type that variable points to.

```yaml
TechnicalAssurances:
  - TechnicalAssuranceTypeID:
      $expr: iif(log_status = "APPROVED", "Certified", "Unevaluated")
      $modifiers: [ref]
    Comment: Set by the well database export
```

- The list is the objects its items give, in the order the items are written, an object two items give alike written
  once.
- A property that gives no value is left out of its item; an item none of whose properties gives a value adds nothing;
  a list none of whose items gives one is written empty.
- A property that holds holds the record, naming the variable inside the items
  (`osdu.data.TechnicalAssurances[].Comment: dataset.remark is empty, and the entry is required`).
- An item written entirely as literals is carried by every record.
- An item has no settings of its own, so a condition goes on the properties it decides for. The wellbore example above
  writes its second vertical measurement only when `rt_elevation` has a value by giving each of its properties the
  same condition.
- A list is one of objects or one of values: `record.data.TechnicalAssurances[1] is a value, and record.data.TechnicalAssurances[0] is an object: the items of a list are all objects, or all values.`
- An item never repeats rows (no `$forEach` inside it), never holds a list of objects of its own, and a list of objects
  is never inside the items of a `$forEach`.

For an array with one item per child row, use a [`$forEach`](#foreach-repeated-arrays-from-a-child-dataset).

## Open objects

An object the schema leaves open declares no properties, names no type for its keys and refuses none:
`data.ExtensionProperties`, which every OSDU kind carries, is one. A mapping lays out what it writes inside one as it
lays out the record: objects, values, literals, lists and a `$forEach`'s items, at any depth.

```yaml
ExtensionProperties:
  WellDb:
    Curves:
      $forEach: curves
      $required: false
      $item:
        CurveID: { $from: curve_id }
        SourceUnit:
          $from: curve_unit
          $required: false
```

- Nothing in the schema types what goes there, so a value is written as it arrives: text stays text (`0100` included),
  unless a modifier such as `number` or `date` writes another form, and nothing checks its shape.
- Everything else holds as anywhere: a value is required unless it says otherwise, a list the mapping defines and no row
  fills is written empty, and a path steps into one array at most.
- A single value written over the open object itself is refused by the preflight (`... is one value, and osdu.data.ExtensionProperties is an object the schema does not break into properties; fill the properties inside it instead`);
  write the properties inside it, or the whole object as a `$value`.
- An object that refuses undeclared keys (`additionalProperties: false`) or offers a choice of forms (`oneOf`, `anyOf`) is
  not open; a property its schema does not declare is refused there as anywhere.
- A flow whose route carries a key over from the stored record into every update (`target.protocolOptions.preserveDataKeys`)
  refuses a mapping that writes under that key, since what it wrote would reach a record only when it is created
  ([routes](routes.md)).

## How a value takes its property's type

The template decides what the record carries, whatever the source column's type:

| The property takes | What is written |
| --- | --- |
| A string | Text as it is; a number in its shortest form; `true` or `false`; a date value in RFC 3339: a full-date where the format is `date` (a value with a time of day holds the record there), a UTC date-time otherwise. Text is never read as a date without the `date` modifier. |
| A number | A number, or text that states one with `.` before the decimals (`"23.5"` is 23.5). Text in another form needs the `number` modifier. A whole number is written exactly, anything else as the nearest double. |
| An integer | A whole number inside the range the property's format declares (`int32`, or 64 bits otherwise). A fraction or a value out of range holds the record. |
| A boolean | `true` or `false`; text `true`, `1`, `yes`, `y`, `false`, `0`, `no` or `n`, ignoring case. Anything else holds the record. |
| A list of values | A list, each item converted to the item type; a single value becomes a list of one. |
| An object | An object (a `$value`, or a cached field holding one). A single value on an object fails the preflight. |
| A list of objects | A list of objects; one object becomes a list of one. |
| Nothing typed (inside an open object) | The value as it arrives: text stays text, a number stays a number, a date value is written as a UTC date-time. |

Several values given to a property that takes one hold the record:
`<n> values were given but the template takes one <type>; read one value or fill a list`. A value that cannot take the
type holds it with the value and the reason (`value 'many' is not a valid integer (...)`). NaN and Infinity are never
written. [Mapping](mapping.md#what-the-record-contains) has what the record carries as a whole: what is left out, lists
written empty, and `meta`.

## Errors

Each message starts with the file. The loader refuses, when the mapping is read:

| Mistake | Message |
| --- | --- |
| A word mixed with properties | `record.data.Name holds '$from', words of the mapping language, beside the property 'Description'; a node's keys all start with '$'. ...` |
| A misspelled word | `record.data.Name: '$form' is not a word of the mapping language. Did you mean '$from'? A property whose name starts with '$' is written $$form.` |
| Two sources | `record.data.Description reads its value with $from and $expr; a node reads one of $from, $expr, $value, $cache, $search, $lookup or $coalesce.` |
| No source | `record.data.Description reads no value: a node reads one with $from, $expr, $value, $cache, $search, $lookup or $coalesce, or repeats the rows of a child dataset with $forEach, and takes its settings ($when) beside it.` |
| A property with no value | `record.data.Description has no value; give it one, or remove it.` |
| An empty object | `record.data.VerticalMeasurement is an empty object; name the properties it holds, or write { $value: {} } for an empty object.` |
| `$required: yes` | `record.data.LogRun: $required is true or false.` |
| `$unverified` without `id` or `ref` | `record.data.LogRun: $unverified lets an id the node builds with id or ref go out when the cache holds no record under it, and this node builds no id; build one, or remove $unverified.` |
| A literal before the last alternative | `record.data.Description.$coalesce[1] is never tried: the literal before it always gives a value. A literal is the last alternative, the value taken when none of the others gives one.` |
| An undeclared parameter | `record.data.LogRun uses {$param.region}, but the mapping declares no parameter 'region'.` |

What a `$when`, a `$where` or an `$expr` is refused for (a condition in the old form, a condition that gives a value, an
expression the language cannot read) is on [mapping expressions](mapping-expressions.md#errors-when-the-mapping-is-read).
The checks against the template (a property it does not have, a shape that does not agree, a required property that may
be left out) and against the ingestion tables and the cache are the [preflight's](../concepts/preflight.md).
