// The submissions runs work on, and the ones no run works on any more (osdu/docs/reference/concepts/submissions.md,

// reopens the submission until it is done with it, so a submission left received, planned or running with no holder and
// no lease that has not run out is one whose run ended before settling it. The next deliver run of the flow takes it
// over, sends what it holds and closes it; an attempt of a run the platform executes again resumes the one its interrupted
// attempt left.
