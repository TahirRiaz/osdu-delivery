/// lock on the whole table, which would stop every other node while it ran. Staging copies the whole batch once and
/// writes it a slice at a time, each slice in a transaction of its own, so a record is staged whole or not at all and a
/// failure keeps the slices before it. An append only adds rows, at the end of two tables clustered on ever-increasing
