# Test templates

Schemas the suites save as templates beside the sample estate's own (`osdu/samples/recall-welllog/templates`), for the
cases the sample estate does not carry.

| File | Kind | Template version | Origin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `osdu_wks_work-product-component--WellLog_1.5.0.json` | `osdu:wks:work-product-component--WellLog:1.5.0` | `2f8a99cb38d32480` | OSDU data definitions v0.30.0 (99f8fc88d8ad), `Generated/work-product-component/WellLog.1.5.0.json` |

Each file is the schema as `sqlflow template capture --kind <kind> --release <release>` saves it: fetched from the Open
Group's data definitions and bundled with every shared schema it refers to, then written out with two-space
indentation. The template version is computed from the schema's content, so the indentation does not change it. The
schemas are published under the Apache License 2.0, which each file carries in `x-osdu-license`.

`SchemaVersionPipelinesTests` uses WellLog 1.5.0 to deliver the sample well log rows through a second pipeline on the
next version of the kind the sample flow delivers (WellLog 1.4.0).
