//! The OSDU Delivery MCP server: SQLFlow's MCP server composed with the delivery module.
//!
//! SQLFlow's server is a library a host composes (`sqlflow/tools/sqlflow-mcp`), as its control plane and its CLI are.
//! This crate is that host for OSDU Delivery. [`module`] is what the delivery module adds: the `delivery_*` tools over
//! the module's endpoints, its section of the instructions, the product's documentation, the GUI routes of its rows,
//! and the key census of the flow kinds and documents it adds. [`host`] is the program: its name, where it keeps its
//! sign-in, and the tools of SQLFlow's it does not offer.
//!
//! The server answers from metadata. A delivery tool returns the ledger's bookkeeping (states, ids, counts, history,
//! errors) and the module's definitions (flows, mappings, templates, what a cache is made of), never record content,
//! a source row, a cached value or a dimension's values. The one read of data is a `!` question's: SQLFlow's query
//! tools run a single read-only SELECT over the columns an approved AI context opens, which the control plane checks
//! on prepare and on run. The tools of SQLFlow's that read rows for anything else are left out ([`WITHHELD`]).
