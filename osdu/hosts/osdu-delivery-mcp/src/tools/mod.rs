//! The delivery module's tools.
//!
//! Every tool is a proxy over the module's own endpoints under `/api/v1/delivery` (osdu/src/SqlFlow.Delivery.ControlPlane),
//! the same ones the GUI and the CLI call. Nothing here reaches OSDU or the ledger's database: a read answers from the
//! ledger through the control plane, and anything that acts (a release, a redelivery, a read of what OSDU holds) goes
//! through the endpoint that records it in the ledger under the caller's name. A tool that composes several reads into
//! one answer still only reads.
//!
//! The tools are grouped as the product is: the ledger's records, flows and submissions, the audit trail, mappings and
//! templates, the partition caches, assertions, dimensions, and the operator's actions.
