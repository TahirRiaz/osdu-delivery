//! The operator's actions: the interventions the ledger records (release, redeliver, verify, sync, a decision on a
//! cache change) and the probe of a flow's target.
//!
//! Every tool here calls an endpoint under the control plane's `operate` policy, so a token without that scope is
//! refused by the control plane, and every intervention is written to the audit trail under the caller's name by the
//! endpoint itself: nothing here is a second path to OSDU. None of them returns data: an action answers with what
//! was queued or how many records it touched.
//!
//! What is deliberately not here: reading what OSDU holds, reading a source row, rendering a record, and removing
//! records from OSDU. The first three return data, which this server never does; the last is an operator's decision
//! made in the GUI, where the confirmation shows what it would take away.
