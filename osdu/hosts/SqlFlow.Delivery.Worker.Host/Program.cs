/// <summary>
/// An OSDU Delivery compute node: SQLFlow's node runtime, with the OSDU module installed so the node can execute the
/// delivery, retrieval, cache, assertion, dimension and inventory flows (and the mapping and dictionary documents they
/// read). It is the CLI's <c>worker</c> verb with nothing else on the command line, which keeps one drain loop, one set
/// of node options and one place where a run is executed, however the node was started.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The container passes only the node's own options (<c>--pool</c>, <c>--poll-seconds</c>, <c>--drain-seconds</c>, and
/// <c>--url</c> / <c>--token</c> when the environment does not carry them); every credential, including the module
/// database connection, is resolved on the node from its own environment.
