// Deploys one OSDU Delivery worker pool as a Container App: a compute node that polls the control plane's
// dispatcher for work. Nodes expose nothing (no ingress; outbound HTTPS to the control plane, outbound SQL to the
// data databases their flows read, outbound HTTPS to the OSDU endpoint, and outbound git for a pinned run
// without a snapshot) and scale 0..N on the control plane's own replica target through the built-in KEDA
// metrics-api scaler, so an idle pool costs nothing and no catalog credential reaches this tier at all. A
// cold-started replica needs only its environment: it polls, is handed a run with its definition and the values it
// resolves with, fetches the snapshotted YAML (or materializes the pinned commit), executes, streams the trace, and
// reports back.
//
// THE OSDU LEDGER ON A NODE. The delivery engine reads and writes the ledger in the `osdu` schema per record
// while it plans and delivers, and a node opens no catalog connection, so the module database needs a connection
// reference of its own on this tier: SQLFLOW_OSDU_DB in secretEnv, pointing at a Key Vault secret holding the
// connection string (osdu/docs/reference/concepts/environment-variables.md). Without it the node refuses to start.
// Everything a run reads beside it (the data databases, the landing storage, the OSDU platform and its client secret)
// is handed to each run by the control plane, from the estate's configuration, as values and ${keyvault:...}
// references this app's identity resolves; so a node carries nothing else.
//
// This is the Container Apps mirror of osdu/deploy/k8s/worker-pool.yaml: deploy one copy per pool (set name and
// pool together). Secrets come from an existing Key Vault, read by the app's user-assigned managed identity;
// that same identity resolves ${keyvault:...} references at run time (SQLFLOW_AZURE_AUTH=mi).
