# The OSDU Delivery MCP server as a container: `osdu-delivery-mcp http`, the streamable HTTP endpoint the control
# plane's chat assistant and any remote MCP client connect to. It is SQLFlow's MCP server composed with the delivery
# module (osdu/hosts/osdu-delivery-mcp): a thin authenticated proxy over the control plane's /api/v1 and the
# documentation compiled into it. It holds NO credentials: it forwards each request's bearer token to the control
# plane, which enforces scopes, and it answers from metadata alone (osdu/docs/reference/guides/mcp.md).
#
# Configuration is environment-only:
#   SQLFLOW_CONTROL_PLANE_URL        base URL of the control plane the tools call (required)
#   SQLFLOW_GUI_URL                  public base URL of the GUI; results carry links into it (a record's page, a
#                                    submission's, a run's). Unset emits root-relative links, which resolve only for
#                                    a client rendering inside the GUI itself
#   SQLFLOW_MCP_HTTP_BIND            listen address (the image sets 0.0.0.0:8080)
#   SQLFLOW_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS   optional Host-header allowlist; unset disables the check, which is safe here
#                                    because every /mcp request must carry a bearer token
#   SQLFLOW_MCP_LOG                  log filter (optional; default info)
#

# The server compiles its documentation and the key census into the binary through repository-relative paths, so the
# build keeps the repository's shape: SQLFlow's server and language engine with the reference pages they embed, and
# the host crate with the product's pages. The root .dockerignore re-includes these documentation trees for this.
