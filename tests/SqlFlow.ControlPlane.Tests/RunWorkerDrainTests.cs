/// The stopping node's drain (<see cref="RunWorker.DrainInFlightAsync"/>). A stop signal is routine in an autoscaled
/// fleet - the scaler reclaims a replica, a revision swaps, an operator restarts a node - and it must mean "stop
/// claiming and finish what you hold", never "sever it". A severed run records no outcome at all, so it is recovered
/// only by the orphan reaper's requeue, which consumes one of its
/// <see cref="SqlFlow.Catalog.RunQueueStore.MaxExecutionAttempts"/> executions and repeats all of its work; three
/// such stops fail the run outright and blame it for dying though nothing was ever wrong with it. These tests pin
/// both halves of the contract: a stop lets in-flight work finish, and the drain is nonetheless bounded so a node
/// never outstays the termination grace period it was given.
